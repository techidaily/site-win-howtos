**c)**  Type the following lines and press enter after each line.

_**bootrec /fixmbr**_
_**bootrec /fixboot**_
_**bootrec /scanos**_
_**bootrec /rebuildbcd**_

**d) Exit** Command Prompt and**restart** your computer. Check and see if your computer can boot normally.  
  
## 3) Reinstall your Windows

 If you still cannot resolve the restart loop, it is possible that something is going wrong with your system. A reinstallation of your Windows can help you get everything back to normal.

**a)** Boot to**Windows Setup** screen and click on**Install now** .
