## Fix 1: Check if your PC supports Miracast

 Miracast is a wireless technology that makes it possible for users to mirror one’s device’s display to another device. Before using it, the first thing you need to do is check if your device supports it.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **dxdiag** , then press **Enter**  on your keyboard.

 3) In the DirectX Diagnostic Tool window, click**Save All Information…** at the bottom.  
  
![check if your Windows 10 PC supports Miracast](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/check-if-your-Windows-10-PC-supports-Miracast.jpg)

 4) When the**Save As** window appears, select**Desktop** so that it’s easy to find. Then click**Save** .  
  
![check-if-your-Windows-10-PC-supports-Miracast](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/check-if-your-Windows-10-PC-supports-Miracast-save-as.jpg)

 5) From your desktop, double-click on the**DxDiag** text file to open it.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DxDiag-text-file.jpg)

 6) Under the**System Information** section, look for**Miracast** . Now you can know whether it’s available or not. If it’s unavailable, then your PC doesn’t support Miracast.  
  
![check-if-your-Windows-10-PC-supports Miracast](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/check-if-your-Windows-10-PC-supports-Miracast-from-DxDiag-text-file.jpg)

 If your computer doesn’t support Miracast, then you would need to buy a wireless adapter such as[Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/adapters/wireless-display-adapter-2/p3q-00001) .

---

## Fix 2: Check if WiFi is enabled on both devices

 Miracast is a WiFi standard. So to connect your computer to another device, you must use WiFi. Many users report that the reason they can’t use Miracast is that they were using Ethernet. After they switched to WiFi, they can connect their computer to other devices. Here’s how you can check if WiFi is enabled on your computer:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **ms-settings:network-wifi** , then press **Enter**  on your keyboard.

![check if WiFi is enabled on computer ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/check-if-WiFi-is-eneabled-on-computer-step-1.jpg)

 3) Click on the toggle to activate WiFi if it’s deactivated.  
  
![check if WiFi is enabled on computer](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/check-if-WiFi-is-eneabled-on-computer-step-2.jpg)

 4)Also, you need to check if WiFi is enabled on other devices. For iOS and Android users, you can usually activate WiFi from the**Settings** app.

 Once enabling WiFi on both your PC and display device, connect them to the same network.

Now you can check if it works:

 1) In the Search box, type**projection** . Select**Projection settings** from the result.  
  
![open projection settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/projection-settings-1.jpg)

 2) The error message should be gone.  
  
![projecting to this PC](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/error-message-gone.jpg)

 If you still have the error message, don’t panic. There are a few other working fixes for you.

## Fix 3: Reinstall your wireless network adapter driver

 If you have WiFi enabled but can’t really connect to WiFi and still see the error message, you should reinstall the wireless network adapter driver. There is a possibility that your wireless network adapter driver is out of date or corrupted, which would prevent you from connecting your PC to the Internet. If the wireless driver is the culprit, reinstalling it will get you back online in minutes. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **devmgmt.msc** , then press **Enter**  on your keyboard.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/open-device-manger.jpg)

 3) Expand**Network adapters** . Select your wireless network adapter driver, right-click on it and select**Uninstall device** .

![uninstalll wireless network adapter driver via Device Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reinstall-wireless-network-adapter-driver.jpg)

 4) Restart your computer and Windows will reinstall the driver automatically. (Note: you need to connect to the network.)

 If reinstalling the wireless network adapter driver didn’t resolve your issue, you should[verify your network driver to check if it’s compatible](#fix4) .

---

## Fix 4: Verify your network driver if it’s compatible

 To check if your network driver is compatible, you can follow the steps below:

 1) Right-click on the Start menu.![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) Then select**Windows PowerShell (Admin)** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows-PowerShell-Admin.jpg)

 2) Click**Yes** when a prompt appears asking for the right.

 3) Copy the command and past in the window. Then hit**Enter** .

Get-netadapter|select Name, ndisversion

 Now you can check your**NdisVersion** . It should be above 6.30 for your wireless card to support Miracast. If it’s below 6.30, you need to[update your wireless network driver](#fix5) .

## Fix 7: Disable third-party VPN

 If you have any third-party VPN software such as Cisco AnyConnect running on your PC, they might be in conflict with you utilizing Miracast mirroring. So to fix it, you should disable them.

---

 To conclude, the error “This device doesn’t support receiving Miracast, so you can’t project to it wirelessly.” can occur due to a variety of reasons which are mainly related to compatibility and network driver issues. So I hope with the fixes in this article, you can resolve your issue. If you have any ideas or questions, please leave us a comment below.
