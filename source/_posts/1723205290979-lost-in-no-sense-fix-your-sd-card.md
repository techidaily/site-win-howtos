 Check to see if the arrow keys work properly. If not, try updating your keyboard driver.

### Fix 4: Update your keyboard driver

 If you’re using a faulty or outdated keyboard driver, you’re likely to encounter the arrow keys not working issue. To see if that’s the case, you should update your keyboard driver to the latest version. If you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2020-03-20_17-06-29-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All)  

 Or click the**Update** button next to the flagged keyboard driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 After updating your keyboard driver, restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

 Test the arrow keys on your keyboard to see if your problem has been resolved. If the issue remains, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Disable the Scroll Lock key

 If the arrow keys are not working as intended in**Excel** , try**disabling the Scroll Lock key** to fix the problem. If the Scroll Lock key is enabled, the whole page will move when you press any of the arrow keys, but the selected cell won’t change. So if you just want to use the arrow keys to move between different cells, you should turn off the Scroll Lock key.

 The Scroll Lock key is often located close to the Pause key. If your keyboard does not have a Scroll Lock key, you can use the On-Screen Keyboard to turn it off. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key + Ctrl + O** at the same time to turn on the**On-Screen Keyboard** .
2. When the On-Screen Keyboard appears, click the**ScrLk** button to disable it.
