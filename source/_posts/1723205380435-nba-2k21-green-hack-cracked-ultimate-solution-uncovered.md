 While attempting to upgrade to Windows 10, if you stuck at 90% for a long time, it must be annoying. Fortunately, you can fix this issue by using the solutions here. Read on to find the detail steps.  

##

**Solution 1: Do Nothing but Wait**

 This sounds unbelievable. But this solution has worked for many windows users who meet the same problem. The process seems to stuck but it actually is running.  
  
 The upgrade process usually takes 90 minutes or less or complete. But in some cases, the process can take longer than typical. So you can wait longer and see if it works. The longest time would be 24 hours. If the issue persists after 24 hours, stop waiting and try other solutions.  

##

**Solution 2: Stop Windows Update Service**

 This solution also works in most cases. Follow steps below to stop the Windows Update service.

 1\. Press**Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time. A Run dialog box will open.  
  
 2\. Type **services.msc** in the run box and click**OK** button.

 5\. Click**OK** button.  
  
 6\. Reboot your PC and perform the upgrade again.  
  
 If that doesn’t work either, try to delete the Windows Update Cache. After that, Windows 10 should upgrade successfully.  
  
 Open**C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution** and delete all contents there.
