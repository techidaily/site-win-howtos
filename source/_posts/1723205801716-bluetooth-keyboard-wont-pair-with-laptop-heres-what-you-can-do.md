## 7 Fixes for bluetooth keyboard not working

## Fix 3: Update your Bluetooth driver

 A faulty or outdated driver is one of the most common causes of Bluetooth keyboard not connecting. To see if that’s the case for you, you should update your Bluetooth driver to the latest version.

 You can manually update your Bluetooth driver by going to the manufacturer’s website, downloading the latest driver, and then installing it.

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 **Driver Easy is a driver update tool that can automatically identify and download all the drivers you need.** You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong drivers, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
