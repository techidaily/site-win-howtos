5)**Save**your changes, and reboot your computer. This should fix your problem.

## **Solution 3: Update your drivers**

The driver problem can also cause the error 0xc00000e9, because the hardware can’t communicate with the software if there’s something wrong with drivers. You should **verify that all your devices have the right and latest drivers and update those that don’t**.

**Note** : Before updating drivers, you should boot your computer in**Safe Mode with Network** . (You can check this article for more information about **[how to enter Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .)

**Manual driver update**– You can update your drivers manually by going to the**manufacturer’s website**and searching for the**most recent correct driver**.

Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/img_5aaf6cdfc84d7.png)3) Click the**Update**button next to all flagged devices to automatically download and install the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE**version). Or click**Update All**to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All**).

4) Restart your computer and see if the error 0xc00000e9 disappears.

## **Solution 4: Run a disk check**

The error 0xc00000e9 can be caused by the disk problem. You should make sure that your disk works properly. 1) Boot your computer into**Safe Mode**. (You can check this article for more information about **[how to enter Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .) 2) In the search box on your desktop, type**cmd**.
