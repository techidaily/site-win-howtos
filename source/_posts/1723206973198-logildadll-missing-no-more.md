2. Once it got a hit in the database, you will see the available dll files. You can then click the file and follow the instruction on the page to download the file to the designated location.
3. Note that sometimes you may find that there are multiple files available. Mostly you can simple pick the highest version. But when the versions are the same, it could mean that the files work for different architecture. To find out the architechure of your system (whether it’s 64-bit or 32-bit), you can open[Windows Settings](ms-settings:about?activationSource=SMC-Article-15056) and check the**System type** .

### **Bonus tip: Update your Logitech mouse driver**

 If you haven’t updated the driver for your Logitech mouse for a long time, we highly recommend you update it to the latest version. By updating the outdated drivers to the latest version, you can avoid many computer issues. There are two ways to update your Logitech mouse driver: manually and automatically.

**Update your Logitech mouse driver manually**  – You can update your Logitech mouse driver manually by going to the official website of **[Logitech](https://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/category/mice-and-pointers)**  , and searching for the latest driver for your Logitech mouse. Be sure to choose the driver that is compatible with your Windows system.

**or**

**Update your drivers automatically**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

You can update your drivers automatically with either **the FREE**  or **the Pro version**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-backguarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Snap43.png)
3. Click **Update**  next to your Logitech mouse to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can install it manually. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** ).
