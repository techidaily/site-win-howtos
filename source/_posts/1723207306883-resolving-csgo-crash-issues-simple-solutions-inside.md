### Fix 2: Stop overclocking your GPU

 Overlocking the GPU is a good method to try if you wish for a faster and smoother game performance. But pushing it too high may cause the game crashing issue.

 If you ever overlocked you GPU and encounter the CS:GO crashing issue,  
 you can try lowering it back to the default setting. If not, or it doesn’t help with the situation, you should try **Fix 3** .

---

### Fix 3: Verify integrity of game files

 You may have this**CSGO crashing** issue if some files of your game installation are corrupt or have been deleted as a false positive by antivirus programs. So you can verify the integrity of game files to see if it fixes the issue.

To do so:

 1) In Steam, go to**LIBRARY** .

 2) In your list of games, locate and right-click on **Counter -Strike: Global Offensive** in your list of games and click **Properties** .

### Fix 4: Launch CSGO in -autoconfig or -safe mode

 You can also try running CSGO in a different mode to see if the crashing issue disappears. Here we recommend the**\-autoconfig** mode and the**\-safe** mode.

 You can use only ONE of these launch options at a time. Once the game crashing issues have been resolved, you’ll need to remove these modes.
