 (If granting Steam with administrative rights didn’t solve the issue, proceed to the next[fix2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . )

 3) Exit Steam and make sure it’s not running in the background. You can press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box. Type in**taskmgr** and press**Enter** . Navigate to all the Steam services. Right-click on each and select**End task** .

 3) Click **Change settings** if it’s enabled on your end. Then click **Allow another app** .  
  
![allow VALORANT through windows firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/allow-another-app-1.jpg)

 Then you can follow the on-screen instructions to add Steam to the list. By default, the location of the main Steam executable is**C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\bin** .

 If you have other anti-virus software running, make sure you disable them temporarily.
