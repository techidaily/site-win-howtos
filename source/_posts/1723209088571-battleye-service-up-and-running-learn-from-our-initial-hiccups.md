## 1) Change installation location

You may encounter an error 1603 because the installation location is you choose is not available due to various reasons — such as being encrypted. You can use another installation folder to install the program and see if the error is gone.

## 2) Completely uninstall the same program installed

If you have previously installed the same program (or its earlier version), the error can occur when you try to install the application again. If you want to install your program successfully, you need to perform a **clean uninstall** of the one installed on your computer. This means you need to remove all the temporary files and preferences it leaves in addition to the major program. Sometimes you may lose the desktop shortcut of a program due to some reasons and therefore you may forget that you have installed it. In this case you can go to**Control Panel**to check if it is still on your computer: Press**Win + R**, and enter “ _**control**_“;

Find and open**Programs and Features**;

Then you can check if the application is listed here. If it is, uninstall it.

## 4) Acquire full permissions on the drive for installation

It is possible that the error 1603 occurs because you don’t have**full permissions**on the file location. Try getting the permissions on the drive you are installing your application to and see if this fixes the problem.**a)** Open**File Explorer**, right click on the drive containing the installation location and select**Properties**.
