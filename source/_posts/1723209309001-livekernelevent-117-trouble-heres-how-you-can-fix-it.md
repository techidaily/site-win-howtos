## 2\. Clean reinstall graphics card driver

 If an older display card driver doesn’t help to fix the LiveKernelEvent 117 error, then it’s probably related to a faulty or missing graphics card driver. So making sure that you have the latest and the correct graphics card driver installed is one of the first things you should do.

 To make sure that there are no old bad graphics card driver files left in your system, here’s what you need to do first:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and the **R** key at the same time, then type **devmgmt.msc**  and hit **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-22.png)
2. Double-click to expand the **Display adapters** category, then right-click your display card and select **Uninstall device** .

4. Repeat the same to remove the driver for your other display card if you have one.
5. Then update your graphics card driver.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

## 3\. Make sure your computer is not overheated

 According to some users, the LiveKernelEvent 117 error happens to them when their CPU and GPU is running hot. So if the ventilation for your computer is rather poor, or not strong enough for all your hardware components, then there’ll be problems like sudden computer shut down and constant computer or keyboard and mouse freezes, among many other PC performance issues.

 If you can feel the heat on your computer case or on your computer itself, or you can hear the fan(s) running very loud when you run resource-hungry software programs (like games), you need a cooler environment for your machine to make sure that the LiveKernelEvent 117 error doesn’t happen again.

 Here is a detailed post for your reference if your computer is overheating: **[How to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 4\. Stop overclocking your GPU and/or CPU

 Overclocking your CPU and GPU can enhance your PC performance, especially if you’re a gamer. But doing so will also add more pressure to your hardware components, and therefore cause instability, overheating, and damage to them if done excessively or improperly. The LiveKernelEvent 117 error could then be a result of overclocking.

 So if you’re doing it, please stop now to see if it helps to eliminate the LiveKernelEvent 117 error from your computer. If not, please move on.

## 5\. Repair damaged or corrupted system files

**Repairing corrupted or damaged system files** could help fix issues like the LiveKernelEvent 117 error. This is because the integrity of Windows system files are essential for proper operation and stability, while errors in critical system files can cause crashes, freezes, and problems that affect the overall computer performance.

 You can run SFC and DISM checks to see if there are damaged system files to repair, but there are chances that these tools can’t fix the corrupted files either. Tools like **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  can automate the repair process by scanning system files and replacing corrupted ones.

## 6\. Update BIOS

 If you’re not confident enough to do a BIOS update, please skip this, as wrongly updating BIOS could cause server computer problems, even brick the computer in some extreme cases.

 The LiveKernelEvent with code 117 error could also be caused by outdated BIOS, according to some users. Even though a BIOS update won’t usually boost your computer performance, it can, however, fix problems or bugs related to certain hardware, and thus stop problems like LiveKernelEvent 114.

 You can refer to this post we have regarding **[how to update the BIOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## 7\. Consider a system reset

 If the LiveKernelEvent with code 117 error still remains unfixed at this point, we’re afraid that the last resort would be a system reset. It wipes out all software incompatibilities and problems, it’s also the rule of thumb in telling a software problem from a hardware one: if the problem remains even after a system reset, then it’s definitely a hardware problem.

 To reinstall or reset your computer, here’s a post for your reference: [ **Reinstall/Reset Windows 10 \[Step By Step\]** ](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 If the LiveKernelEvent with code 117 error is still seen after a reset, then the next thing you should do is seek help from a hardware technician to see if your hardware components are at fault.
