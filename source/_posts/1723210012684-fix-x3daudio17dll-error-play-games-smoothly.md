## Method 5: Update your drivers

 The kernel32.dll error may be caused by corrupted hardware drivers. Updating drivers not only fix the error but also improves your computer performance.  
 There are two ways you can get the right drivers: manually or automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](#op1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 –** Download and install the driver manually

 Devices keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

## Method 6: Check your system memory

 One of the reasons for the Kernel32.dll error is poor contact, defective or mismatched RAM (Random Access Memory).  
 You can physically or use the**Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool** to check your RAM.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123512/26400" target="_top" id="2123512">

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123512/26400" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Physical Check

1. Plug your RAM in and out to make sure it has been installed properly and steadily.
2. Clean your RAM if it’s dusty. And don’t forget the RAM slot
3. Reboot your computer to check whether the problem exists.

### Use the Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** \+ **R** together to open the Run box.
2. Type “mdsched.exe” and click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snap808-1.jpg)
3. Click **Restart now and check for problems** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snap809-2.jpg)

**The result can lead to two situations:**

**A** : Your RAM has no problem. Then move to the next method.

**B** : The test result indicated that the computer suffers from a bad memory. You should replace your RAM with a new one.  
 Then restart your computer and check to see the Kernel32.dll error will appear or not.

---

## Method 7: Repair hard disk errors

 In some cases, the kernel32.dll error could be attributed to hard drive corruption.  
**Check Disk Utility(chkdsk.exe)** is a useful tool offered by Windows that can be used to check the hard drive for bad sectors and fix them if possible.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and **R** key at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type “cmd” and press **Shift+Ctrl+Enter** together to open **Command Prompt** in the administrator mode.  
**Note** : Do **NOT** click OK or just press the Enter key as that won’t allow you to open Command Prompt in the administrator mode.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/command-prompt-1.jpg)
3. Type the following command line and press the **Enter** key on your keyboard.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**chkdsk x: /f**  
**Note** : The letter “x” means the disk drive that you want to scan and repair for. The tool is often used for the Windows installation drive which is usually C drive. If you want to scan and repair C drive, replace “x” with “c”.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snap828-1.jpg)
4. After the scanning and repairing process is done, restart your PC and check to see if the error is resolved.

## Method 8: Perform a clean installation

 If all else fails, you may have to[reset Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , or maybe even[reinstall it](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) together. We all know reinstalling will delete all the data on your hard drive, you have to[back up all your important files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) before doing it.

 However, with[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , there’s **no need for lengthy back-ups, support phone calls, or risk to your personal data** . It can reset Windows to the state exactly when it was just installed without affecting third-party software.
