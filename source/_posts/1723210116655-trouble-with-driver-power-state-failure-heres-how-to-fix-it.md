## Trouble with Driver Power State Failure? Hereâ€™s How to Fix It

If you encounter a blue screen error with the message**DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE** , you can try using solutions here to fix the issue.

[Stop 0x0000009F (DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE)](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Stop-0x0000009F-DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE-500x332.png) ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Stop-0x0000009F-DRIVER%5FPOWER%5FSTATE%5FFAILURE.png)

 As you can see from the blue screen, the**DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE** error has a value of 0x0000009F which indicates that the driver is in an inconsistent or invalid power state.

* Going to or returning from Sleep mode
* Going to or returning from Hibernate mode
* Shutting down or starting computer

**To resolve the problem, you can try updating the drivers.**

If you are not sure which driver you need to update, you can try updating these three drivers on each to the latest version and see if the problem resolves.
