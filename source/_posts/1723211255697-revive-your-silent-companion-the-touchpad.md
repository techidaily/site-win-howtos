## Fix 2: Add the touchpad driver back manually

 If you know the manufacturer of your touchpad (Synaptics and Elan are two of the most popular ones), you can also try to add the touchpad device back manually in Device Manager to see if it works for you. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **X** at the same time. Then select **Device Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Snap595.png)
2. In Device Manager, select the first line (your computer name), then click **Action** on the menu bar and select **Add legacy hardware** .

6. As mentioned, two of the most popular touchpad manufacturers are**Elan** and**Synaptics** , so you can select one of them on the**Manufacturer** list on the left side, and then see if you can find the touchpad device on the right side. Sometimes, you may also need to check if your touchpad is listed under the**Microsoft** umbrella. You can also try your laptop manufacturer’s name, like Acer, Asus, HP Dell, etc., to see if your touchpad is listed under them.

## Fix 3: Update the touchpad driver

 As you may have known, this problem may occur if you are using the wrong touchpad driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your touchpad driver to see if it fixes your problem. In the condition that the Device Manager can’t work for you, there are two other ways you can update your touchpad driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](#option-1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (recommended)](#option-2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 To get the driver of your touchpad, you need to go to the official website of your device’s brand, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32-bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Automatically update touchpad drivers

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6_0_scan-now.jpg)
3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation.

## Fix 4: Configure the BIOS settings

 Whenever your computer is booted, the BIOS is the first to be activated for operating system loading and device data reading. For some reason, your touchpad may be disabled in the BIOS and therefore can’t be displayed in Device Manager. So you might need to check your BIOS and set it to default. Here’s how:

1. Restart your PC and keep**pressing the assigned BIOS hotkey** ( table below for your reference) as soon as you see the Windows logo on the screen to enter the BIOS settings.

| ASUS                      | F2 for all PCs, F2 or DEL for motherboards |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Dell                      | F2 or F12                                  |
| HP                        | ESC or F10                                 |
| Lenovo                    | F2 or Fn + F2                              |
| Lenovo (Desktops)         | F1                                         |
| Lenovo (ThinkPads)        | Enter + F1.                                |
| Microsoft Surface Tablets | Press and hold the volume up button        |
| Samsung:                  | F2                                         |
| Sony                      | F1, F2, or F3                              |

Assigned BIOS hotkey

1. After entering the BIOS, find the option that allows you to restore the BIOS under the**Security** tab or the**Exit** tab.  
**Note:** Depending on what motherboard you have, the name of the option allowing you to restore the BIOS could be**Reset to Default** ,**Load Factory Defaults** ,**Load Setup Defaults** ,**Load Optimized Defaults** , etc.
2. Select**Yes** in the window for confirmation.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/defalts.jpg)
3. Once done, press the key next to**Save** and**Exit** .
4. Restart your computer to see if the issue is fixed.

 If this method doesn’t work, then try the last one below.

## Fix 5: Repair corrupt files

 If none of the above fixes work for you, you might want to consider**a holistic scan for a file check** on your PC. Because if your computer has corrupted system files or critical system files missing, your touchpad also won’t function properly.

Fortect is a powerful tool that is tailored to your specific system and operates privately and automatically.
