### Option 1: Manually update your drivers

 To manually update your audio and graphics drivers, you need to navigate to the official websites and download the correct drivers compatible with your system.

 Here are some main manufacturers of audio and graphics drivers. Simply click on the links based on your own need and follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the correct drivers.

## Fix 9: Remove audio hardware

 If neither**setting your audio device as the default device** nor**updating drivers** help solve the problem, you should remove your audio hardware. Hardware such as headphones or external speakers could be interfering with your streaming. In order to prevent the conflict, you should remove the audio hardware and try loading the stream again. If the error disappears, you can plug it back.
