## 5 fixes for Google Chrome not responding

 The screenshots below are from**Windows 10** , but the fixes also work in**Windows**   **8.1** and**7** .

  You may not have to try all the fixes; just work down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Clear cache and cookies](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Turn off Chrome add-ons](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Allow Chrome through Windows Defender Firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Update or re-install Chrome](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Clear cache and cookies

 Cache and cookies are some temporary data that help speed up webpage loading. But too much of them may overload Chrome and cause this**Google** **Chrome not responding** problem. So in order to **clear cache and cookies** :

1. Open Chrome.
2. On the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **More tools** \> **clear browsing data** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1df7b87cca5.jpg)
3. In the drop-down menu, click to select **the time range** for the data cache clearing (Last 7 days in my example). Then click **CLEAR DATA** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1df83c76d86.jpg)
4. Run Chrome and hopefully the**Google Chrome not responding** problem has been sorted. If yes, then great! But if the issue persists, you should try**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Turn off Chrome add-ons

 Add-ons are extensions to Chrome that allow you to do more things in your browser, or which improve your  user experience. For example, the AdBlock add-on blocks ads. Extensions are sometimes added manually and sometimes added by other programs on your computer (hopefully with your permission).

 If you have too many add-ons, they can may overload your browser and cause the **Google Chrome not responding**  issue.

1. Open Chrome.
2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **More tools** \> **Extensions** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b432bba1ea5a.jpg)
3. Toggle off all the extensions on your Chrome.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1e199b56ceb.png)
4. **Restart**  your computer and check if**Google Chrome**  now works:

* If Google Chrome does respond after disabling all your add-ons, itâ€™s likely one of your add-ons was the problem. Now you just need to figure out which one. To do this, enable the first add-on in the list, then see if Google Chrome still works. If it doesnâ€™t, then youâ€™ve found the cause of the problem. If Google Chrome works fine after enabling the first add-on, enable the second and test again. Continue testing each add-on in this way until you find the one that stops Internet Explorer from working. Once you find it, disable it again. If you need it, contact the vendor for support.
* If disabling your add-ons doesnâ€™t solve the **Chrome not responding**  issue, please try **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 5: Update or reinstall Chrome

 If all else fails, then we might have to update Chrome to see if thereâ€™s any bugfix in it that will solve the Chrome not responding issue.

 Updating Chrome will not touch any of your browser settings or data, and is considered as a safe option in most cases.

To do so:

1. Open Chrome.
2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **help** \>**About Google Chrome** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b433a86ba999.jpg)
3. Google Chrome automatically detects if thereâ€™s an update available:  
   * If yes, follow the on-screen instruction to finish the update.  
   * If no, delete Chrome and re-install it on Windows store or other trustworthy third-party website. (**NOTE** : This will erase your Chrome browser settings and data)
4. Check if the**Google** **Chrome not responding** issue has been resolved.
