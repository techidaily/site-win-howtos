 If you‚Äôve got an ‚Äú**Failed to install BattlEye Service** ‚Äù error on your game, you‚Äôre not alone. Many gamers are having this error occurring when they launch their game. This usually happens on games that have the BattlEye anti-cheat service, such as PUBG, Fortnite, ARMA 3, Tom Clancy‚Äôs Rainbow Six Siege, etc.

 This is very frustrating. You can‚Äôt play your game because of this error. But don‚Äôt worry. It can be fixed‚Ä¶

#### Fixes to try

 The following are a few methods that have helped many people. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Restart your computer**](#a)
2. [**Run your game as an administrator**](#b)
3. [**Run the BattlEye launcher as an administrator**](#c)
4. [**Run the BattlEye installer manually**](#d)
5. [**Verify integrity of your game files**](#e)
6. [**Update your device drivers**](#f)

## Method 1: Restart your computer

 Your BattlEye service might fail to install because there are temporary corruption issues occurring on your computer. You should try**restarting your computer** and see if this fixes your error. If it does, great. But if not, there are still several things to try‚Ä¶

## Method 2: Run your game as an administrator

 Running your game with administrative privileges is another useful fix for this error:

## Method 4: Run the BattlEye installer manually

 When the game has failed to install the BattlEye service for you, you can install it manually. To do so:

**1)** Open File Explorer (by pressing the**Windows logo key** and**E** on your keyboard at the same time), then go to the**BE Service directory** (usually_C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\BattlEye_ ).

**2)** Run **install\_BattlEye.bat/install\_BattlEye** . This will install the BattleEye service.

**3)** Run your game and see if this fixes your error.

## Method 5: Verify integrity of your game files

 You should have all BattlEye files required before you can install this service successfully. So you fail to install it, you should**reinstall your game** or**verify the files of BattlEye or your game on Steam** .

To verify your game files integrity on Steam:

**1)** Open your Steam client and log in. Under**LIBRARY** , right-click your game title and select**Properties** .
