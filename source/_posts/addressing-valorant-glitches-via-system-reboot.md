## 1: Some quick fixes to try first

 Here are some quick fixes that you can try when your Surface keyboard is not working properly.

1. Disconnect the keyboard from your Surface, then restart your Surface, and reconnect the keyboard.
2. Press the Caps and the Fn keys on your Surface keyboard several times to see if the LED lights turn on or not.  
   * If the lights are on, the type cover or the keyboard itself should be fine, and the problem is on the Windows or software front.  
   * If the lights don’t turn on, it’s probably a hardware problem with your keyboard. In that case, you can submit a service ticket to Microsoft and get your keyboard checked.
3. Make sure your Windows system is updated to the latest version.

 If these methods don’t help to bring back your keyboard, please move on to the other fixes below.

## 2: Perform a two-button shutdown

 There may be corruption issues with your tablet hardware that interfere with your keyboard, and a simple restart is not enough to get rid of them. You need to perform a**two-button shutdown** or**force a shutdown** to turn off your tablet completely.

 You can perform a two-button shutdown only using a **Surface Pro** and**Surface Book** . To do so:

1. Press and hold the**power button** on the edge of your device for around**30** seconds and then release it.
2. Press and hold the**power button** and the**volume-up (+) button** on the edge of your Surface at the same time for about**15** seconds and then release them. (**Do NOT let go** the buttons when the Surface logo pops up on the screen.)
3. Wait for about**10** seconds.
4. **Power on** your Surface. If this methods solves your problem, your keyboard will be recovered.

 **\***  For **Surface 3, 2**  or**RT** , you need to**force a shutdown**  instead:

 Press and hold the**power button** of your device and release it after **10** seconds. Then power on your device to see if this method works.

## 4: Disable the filter key

**Filter Keys** is a feature that makes your keyboard ignore brief or repeated keystrokes. It sometimes leads to the issue of the keyboard not working on Surface. For some users, **disabling Filter Keys** helps to fix the keyboard problem for them. To see if this does wonders for you as well:

### Windows 10

1. Click the Start menu (the Windows logo) at the bottom left of your screen. Then click **Settings** .

## 5: Try the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit

 Surface Diagnostic Toolkit (SDT) is a quick way to tell if your keyboard problem is a hardware one or a software one. So if none of the above helps, you can try it and see if you need to submit a ticket to Microsoft support for hardware repair or replacement.

 To run SDT, please visit this post here:[**Use Surface Diagnostic Toolkit**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/surface-diagnostic-toolkit-desktop-mode)

 If the keyboard problem is fixed after using the SDT, then congrats. But if the problem with your Surface keyboard is on the hardware front, which can’t be simply repaired by SDT, then the next step should be a Microsoft ticket submission.
