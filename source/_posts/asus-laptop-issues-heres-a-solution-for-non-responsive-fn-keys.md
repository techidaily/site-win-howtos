## ASUS Laptop Issues? Here's a Solution for Non-Responsive Fn Keys

 When the hot keys on your ASUS notebook lose their functions, you can’t use them properly. If the hotkeys on your ASUS laptop stop working, in this post you will find the solutions, which apply to Windows 10, 7, 8, 8.1, XP & Vista.

## **Solution 1: Open HControl.exe file**

 Navigate to **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ASUS\\ATK Package\\ATK Hotkey\\Hcontrol.exe** . Then Press**Enter** key. This is the easiest solution. Try it and see if the problem resolves.

## **Solution 2: Repair ASUS Hotkey Application**

Follow the steps below:

 1\. Go to**Control Panel** \->**Programs and Features** .  
 2\. Find and locate the program “**ATK Package** ” from the list.  
 3\. Right-click on it and**Repair** on the context menu.
 4\. Restart your PC for the change to take effect.

## **Solution 3: Update the Drivers**

 If solution 1 and solution 2 don’t work for you, try updating the hotkey drivers. If you don’t have time, patience, or computer skills to update the drivers manually,  you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update** button next to the Asus hot key driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
