### Fix 5: Disable the Scroll Lock key

 If the arrow keys are not working as intended in**Excel** , try**disabling the Scroll Lock key** to fix the problem. If the Scroll Lock key is enabled, the whole page will move when you press any of the arrow keys, but the selected cell won’t change. So if you just want to use the arrow keys to move between different cells, you should turn off the Scroll Lock key.

 The Scroll Lock key is often located close to the Pause key. If your keyboard does not have a Scroll Lock key, you can use the On-Screen Keyboard to turn it off. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key + Ctrl + O** at the same time to turn on the**On-Screen Keyboard** .
2. When the On-Screen Keyboard appears, click the**ScrLk** button to disable it.
