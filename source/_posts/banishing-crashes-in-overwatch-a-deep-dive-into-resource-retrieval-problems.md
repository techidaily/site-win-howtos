### Method 2: Update your keyboard driver and HID driver

Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows system type.**Automatic driver update –**If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your keyboard and HID drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .
