 If you’ve set your audio device as the default device but the error code still appears, you should try updating your drivers, especially audio and graphics drivers. There is a possibility that some of your installation files for the device drivers get corrupted.

 Here are two options you can take to update your drivers:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 2: Automatically update your drivers (recommended)

 If you update the drivers on your own, you might risk downloading the wrong versions.

 4) Restart your computer and load the streaming to check if the error still appears. If updating the drivers doesn’t resolve the issue, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 9: Remove audio hardware

 If neither**setting your audio device as the default device** nor**updating drivers** help solve the problem, you should remove your audio hardware. Hardware such as headphones or external speakers could be interfering with your streaming. In order to prevent the conflict, you should remove the audio hardware and try loading the stream again. If the error disappears, you can plug it back.

## Fix 10: Switch to the Twitch desktop app

 If none of the methods listed above work for you, then you should use the Twitch[desktop app](https://www.twitch.tv/downloads/) . Compared to the web version, the Twitch desktop app has proved to have better performance and it brings better responsiveness.
