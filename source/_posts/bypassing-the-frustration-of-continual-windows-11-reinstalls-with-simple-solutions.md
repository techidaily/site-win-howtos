### Fix 1: Turn off airplane mode

 Before going about troubleshooting the Windows 10 stuck in airplane mode problem, let’s get one simple question out of the way: is your computer really STUCK in the airplane mode?

 Here are three different methods for you to turn off airplane mode. You might want to try them one by one to see if it really is stuck.

 If you’re certain that airplane mode won’t turn off, please jump to[**Fix 2**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Way 1: Turn off airplane mode via the hard switch**

 Many laptops and tablets have a physical WiFi feature with them to hard switch off and on the airplane mode. It may come in different forms, sometimes a toggle, a button or other times a special combo of keys. For example, some Dell models use a combination of the Function key and the Prnt key to enable and disable the airplane mode. If you’re not sure whether you have this feature built on your machine or what keys or buttons to press, you can consult your PC manual.

 Don’t sweat it though if you don’t have this physical feature or it simply won’t work. Microsoft says that Windows settings can sometimes bypass this hardware switch feature — tweaking it in Windows (see**Way 2** or**Way 3** ) might do the job better.

**Way 2: Turn off airplane mode via Action Center**

 Another way to turn off the airplane mode feature is through Action Center.

To do so:

 1) On the bottom right of your screen, click on the**dialog** icon >**Network** .

 1) On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Windows-logo-key-5.png) and type**airplane mode** . Then click on**Airplane mode** as it pops up as a match.

### Fix 5: Update your WiFi driver

 Your Windows 10 stuck on airplane mode problem is probably being caused by driver issues. The steps above may resolve it, but if they don’t, or you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy is a driver updater tool that will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 Don’t have proper Internet connection at the moment because your computer is stuck on airplane mode? Don’t worry – Driver Easy also comes with it an**offline scan feature** that enables you to update drivers even when you can’t get online.

 It works pretty much like this: you run a scan on the problem computer as usual, use the offline scan feature to save the scan results, upload the scan results file, it finds the correct drivers for you to download, then you transfer it to the problem computer. And that’s it! The process may a bit complex by the looks of it, but it’s in fact a massive helper and time saver, compared to the manual procedure (especially when you don’t have time, patience or computer skills to do it).

Here is a step-by-step walk-through:

 Please make sure that you**have another computer that has Internet access** to download the right driver file and**a USB flash drive** to transfer the file.

 1) On a computer with Internet access, **[download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  Driver Easy. Then save the setup file of Driver Easy in a USB flash drive and transfer it to the target computer (the computer without Internet connection).

 2) On the target computer, run the Driver Easy setup file to install Driver Easy.

 3) Run Driver Easy and click **Tools** in the left pane.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-174.png)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-175.png)
