### **Method 4: Reset TCP/IP on your Windows**

 TCP/IP is the short term for**Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol** , and used as a communication protocol in the private network. They are responsible for different parts when processing the Internet connection. TCP defines how the programs can create the communication channels through a network, while IP is responsible for the address of each packet and make sure it is sent to the correct destination.

 To solve error 651, you can also try to reset TCP/IP to reconnect to the Windows network stack.

 1) Type**cmd** in the search box of the task bar. Right click**Command Prompt** (If you are using Windows 7, right click**cmd** ) to select**Run as administrator** . Then click**Yes** to confirm.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a2e42f5624fb.png)

 2) Copy the command below and paste it in your Command Prompt, then press**Enter** on your keyboard:

netsh int ip reset reset.log

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a309c9ae8874.png)

 3) After the command completed, restart your PC and try to connect again.

### **Method 5: Disable the auto tuning feature**

 The Windows auto-tuning feature enables your Windows to continually monitor routing conditions such as**bandwidth**  and **network delay** . It is turned on by default in your computer.**If you are using the router** as a connecting device, this method probably works for you. Follow the steps below:

 1) Type**cmd** in the search box of the task bar. Right click**Command Prompt** (If you are using Windows 7, right click**cmd** ) to select**Run as administrator** . Then click**Yes** to confirm.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a2e42f5624fb.png)

 2) Copy the command below and paste it in your Command Prompt, then press**Enter** on your keyboard:

Netsh interface tcp set global autotuning=disabled

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a309cf60ba01.png)

 3) After the command completed, try your Internet connection again to see if it works.
