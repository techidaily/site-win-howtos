##  Two Ways to Make a Header in Excel

 One way to add a header in Excel is to use an option in the "Insert" tab. If you are looking to add a header to a specific worksheet, use this method.

 The other way to use a header in Excel is to utilize the "Page Setup" dialog box. Use this method if you want to add a header to multiple worksheets at once.

 Footers are added the same way as headers, so use the same steps below if you want to add a footer to your spreadsheets.

##  How to Insert a Header in a Single Worksheet

 To add a header to your single worksheet in Excel, first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 In your spreadsheet, at the bottom, click the worksheet in which you want to add a header.

![Choose a worksheet.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-excel-select-worksheet.png) 

 In [Excel's ribbon at the top](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-honor-play-40c-to-mac-drfone-by-drfone-android/), click the "Insert" tab.

![Click Excel's &quot;Insert&quot; tab.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-excel-insert-tab.png) 

 In the "Insert" tab, click Text > Header & Footer.

![Select Text > Header & Footer.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-excel-add-header.png) 

 Your worksheet's view will immediately change, and you can now start adding your header.

 At the top of your worksheet, you have a left, middle, and right section to specify your header's content. Click each section and add your header content.

 To stop editing the header, click anywhere outside of the header section.

 To add a line break, press Enter after a line. To insert an ampersand "&" sign, type the "&" key twice.

 If you want to add dynamic content to your header, such as the current page number or [the current date](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-photos-from-android-gallery-app-on-redmi-note-12-5g-by-stellar-photo-recovery-android-mobile-photo-recover/), then in Excel's ribbon at the top, click an appropriate option.

![Select a dynamic item to add to the header.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-dynamic-header-items.png) 

 Similarly, if you'd like a different header for the first page, or different headers for the odd and the even pages, use the "Different First Page" and "Different Odd & Even Pages" options at the top.

![Use different headers.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-different-header.png) 

 To go back to Excel's default viewing mode, in the ribbon at the top, click View > Normal.

![Select View > Normal from Excel's ribbon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7-excel-normal-view.png) 

 And that's it. Your selected worksheet now has your custom header on it.

 Later, if you decide to delete the header, follow the above steps and clear the contents of the header. And you will be all set.

 When you are finished, click "OK" in the box.
