 Sometimes your antivirus software may be the reason for the Destiny 2 stuck on initializing. So disable your antivirus software and try downloading again to check if the issue persists.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus software is disabled.

### Method 6: Set the Windows Secondary Logon is set to automatic

 Windows Secondary Logon allows administrators to log on with a non-administrator account to perform administrative tasks without logging off. The Secondary Logon service must be enabled for Blizzard games to install and run.

1. Press the**Windows logo key** +**R** to open the Run box.
2. Type “services.msc” and press**Enter** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/services.jpg)
3. Locate and right-click**Secondary Logon** in the right pane.
4. Select**Properties** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/servi.jpg)
5. Find Startup type and select**Automatic** in the dropdown menu. Then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ser.jpg)

 Some security programs may turn the secondary logon service off. If the service is disabled again after you’ve switched it to automatic, you must configure your security program to stop disabling the service. Contact your security program’s manufacturer if you need assistance with configuring your security software.

 To have**a better gaming experience** , updating your drivers always a good option. The outdated or wrong drivers for your graphics card, network card, sound card, etc. may cause problems.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gpu1.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with Free version). Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gpu.jpg)
