### Fix 1: Adjust the display resolution and refresh rate

 If screen tearing keeps occurring, it’s possible that your display resolution is configured to a higher point than what your monitor can handle. Adjusting it might help you fix the issue.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win** +**S** (the Windows logo key and the S key) and type**resolution** . Then click**Change the resolution of the display** in the search results.

3. Select**Display adapter properties for Display 1** .

5. A list of different resolutions will show on the screen. Select one according to your hardware specifications.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/list-all-modes.jpg)

 Restart your PC after each time you change the settings and see if screen tearing still appears.

If the problem persists, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 2:**Disable Game Mode and fullscreen optimizations**

 Game Mode, as its name indicates, improves your PC’s performance while you’re playing games. But there are players saying that the mode causes screen tearing during the gameplay. So you might turn off Game Mode and see if anything changes. That’s a plus to the efficiency. Here is how:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win** +**I** (the Windows logo key and the I key) to open Settings. Then select**Gaming** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/windows-settings-gaming.jpg)
2. On the**Game Mode** tab, move the slider to turn off**Game Mode** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/game-mode-off.jpg)
3. On your screen or the folder where you put your game, right click the game icon and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Valorant-right-click.jpg)

 **If the problem persists, you can also disable fullscreen optimizations:**

1. Click the Compatibility tab. Under the settings section, check**Disable fullscreen optimizations** . Then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Valorant-properties.png)

Restart your PC and launch Valorant again to see if the problem is fixed.

if it is not helping, simply move on to the next fix.

### Fix 3:**Change power settings**

 Battery-friendly power settings might reduce graphic processing performance and cause screen tearing. You can change power settings to make sure any graphical processing is not constrained. Follow the steps below:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win** +**R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) to open the Run box. Then type**powercfg.cpl** in the box and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/runcommand-power.jpg)
2. In the Power Options menu, click the**Show additional plans** arrow and select**High performance** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/power-high-perform.jpg)

Restart your PC and check if anything changes.

If nothing changes, you might need to check your graphic drivers.

### Fix 4:**Update graphic drivers**

 Outdated or wrong graphic drivers might cause screen tearing in Valorant. So when you are having display-related issues, don’t forget to check if you are using the right graphic drivers.

 One method is to update drivers manually: visit the manufacturer’s websites and select, download and install the drivers you want.

 But if you would like to skip the trouble of doing it, you can try **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool to detect, download and install drivers that your computer needs. Here is how to use it:

### Fix 5:**Turn on VSync**

 As mentioned before, screen tearing happens in the moments when the game’s frame rate is too high for your monitor to keep up. To fix that, VSync, or vertical sync, could be helpful. It is designed to synchronize the frame rate of a game with your monitor’s refresh rate.

**You can enable it in the NVIDIA Control Panel:**

1. On your desktop, right click in an empty space and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/right-click-nvidia.png)
2. In the left pane, select**Manage 3D Settings** and choose the**Global Settings** tab. Then scroll down to find**Vertical sync** and click the small arrow on its right. Select**On** in the drop-down list and click**Apply** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3d-settings.png)

 Setting Vertical sync to**Adaptive** might also be efficient, according to some players.

 **For AMD users, the feature is called Wait for Vertical Refresh:**

1. At the bottom left of the screen, click the search box and type**amd** . Then click**AMD Radeon Software** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AMD-software.jpg)
2. At the top right corner of the menu, click the settings icon. Then select the**Graphics** tab and navigate to**Wait for Vertical Refresh** . Click the small arrow on its right to open the drop-down menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/amd-graphics.jpg)
3. Click**Always on** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/amd-verticle-refresh-on.jpg)

 NVIDIA and AMD settings will default to application settings. It means that they will respect in-game settings. If you select Always On for NVIDIA/AMD in-game, then VSYNC will remain On when appropriate.

 To enable VSync in Valorant, go to**Settings** \>**VIDEO** \>**GRAPHICS QUALITY** , and set VSync to**ON** :  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Valorant-vsync-on.jpg)

 When VSync is on, you should turn off**Limit FPS Always** in Valorant, or the two settings might conflict with each other.

 To turn off Limit FPS Always in Valorant, go to**Settings** \>**VIDEO** \>**GENERAL** , then set it to**Off** :  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Valorant-limit-fps-always.png)

No luck with that? Keep reading.

### Fix 6:**Apply optimized Valorant Settings**

 No player is playing on a perfect computer. So we do have some suggestions on in-game settings to boost your PC’s display performance. They are personal experiences from enthusiastic players. You could try and see if it fix your problem:

1. In Valorant, go to**Settings** \>**VIDEO** \>**GENERAL** , and set as follows:  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Valorant-general-settings.jpg)
2. Go to**GRAPHICS QUALITY** , and set as follows:  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Valorant-graphics-quality-settings.jpg)

Launch your game again and check for any changes.

If it doesn’t help, move on to the last fix.

### Fix 7:**Cap Valorant’s frame rate manually**

 If you have no luck with the options above, you might want to cap Valorant’s frame rate manually so that it would not exceed the number your PC can handle. Both NVIDIA and AMD can do this. Here is how:

1. On your desktop, right click in an empty space and select**Display settings** in the menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/desktop-right-click-display.jpg)
2. In the left column, click**Display** . Then scroll down to select**Advanced display settings** .

3. Scroll down to the**Refresh Rate** section and you will know the refresh rate of your PC.

**Now you can set the maximum frame rate.**

For NVIDIA users:

1. On your desktop, right click in an empty space and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/right-click-nvidia.png)
2. In the left pane, select**Manage 3D Settings** and navigate to the**Global Settings** tab. Then scroll down to find**Max Frame Rate** and click the small arrow on its right.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3d-settings-max-frame-rate.png)
3. Select**On** and move the slider to your monitor’s refresh rate.

For AMD users:

1. At the bottom left of the screen, click the search box and type**amd** . Then click**AMD Radeon Software** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AMD-software.jpg)
2. At the top right corner of the menu, click the settings icon. Then select the**Graphics** tab and navigate to**Radeon Chill** . Enable it and move the Max FPS slider to your PC’s frame rate.
