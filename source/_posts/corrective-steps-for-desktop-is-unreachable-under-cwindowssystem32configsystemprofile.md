### Bonus tip

A missing or outdated graphics driver may also stop items from appearing properly on PC. You should make sure your graphics card driver is up to date. There are two ways to update your graphics driver: **manually** and **automatically**.

**Update your graphics driver manually** ‚Äî You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer‚Äôs website, and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that‚Äôs compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your graphics driver automatically** ‚Äî If you don‚Äôt have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**. You don‚Äôt need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don‚Äôt need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don‚Äôt need to worry about making a mistake when installing.
