### Fix 1 – Update DirectX

First, check the DirectX version on your PC.

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and R at the same time to invoke the Run command. Type**dxdiag** and click**OK** .

 Follow the on-screen instruction to install the latest Windows update, which may take a while. Once done, check if the DirectX version is updated. If the problem persists, continue to the next fix.

### Fix 2 – Update your GPU driver

 Drivers handle the communication of your hardware like GPU with the computer system. If it’s faulty or updated, your GPU won’t work properly and relevant errors occur. To keep your devices in tip-top condition, you should update their drivers on a regular basis. And here are two ways to do that:

#### Option 1 – Manually

 To get your GPU driver, you need to visit the manufacturer’s website ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  , **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)**  , or **[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)**  ), find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32-bit), and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the GPU driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the**Pro version** – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
