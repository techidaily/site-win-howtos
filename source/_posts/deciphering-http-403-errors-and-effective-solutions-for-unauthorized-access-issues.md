![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59e6d500051c8.png)

 If you are seeing an**access denied** file or folder error on your Windows system, you are not alone. Many Windows users have got it. This usually occurs when they are accessing or making changes to a file or folder. Sometimes the error appears when upgrading from a previous version of Windows.

**Why does the error appear?**

 In many cases, you can get this error because you don’t have the appropriate ownership or permissions to access or change the file or folder. But the error may also occur if the file or folder is corrupted.

**How can you fix it?**

 This is an annoying issue. It stops you from opening or changing the file or folder. And there may be some important data in that folder but you can’t access them now. But not to worry. Here are a few tips that can help you fix this error or save your data:

 Method 1:[**Take the ownership of the file or folder**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
 Method 2:[**Get the proper permissions**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
 Method 3:[**Recover your data**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Method 3: Recover your data

 It is also possible that you get the access denied error because the file or folder you are accessing is corrupted. You can’t open it or make any changes.
