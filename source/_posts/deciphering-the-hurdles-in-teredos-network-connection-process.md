### Fix 1: Connect to the Destiny 2 server in another time

So you can wait for a while and try playing the game in another time. This issue can be automatically fixed. If you still have the error “**Destiny 2 servers are not available**”, don’t worry. There’s something else to try.

### Fix 2: Disable DHCP for your connection
