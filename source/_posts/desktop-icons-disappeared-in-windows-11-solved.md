### Fix 3: Update your Wi-Fi adapter driver

 **One of the main causes of the Wi-Fi option not showing up is that you’re using a corrupted or outdated wireless adapter driver.** To ensure your Wi-Fi network works properly, you need to update your Wi-Fi adapter driver to the latest version.

 You can go to the manufacturer’s website, search for the latest driver for your wireless network adapter, and then download and install it manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  

 Or click the**Update** button to download the latest wireless adapter driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Now check to see if your problem has been resolved. If not, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Run the Network Adapter troubleshooter

 If updating the Wi-Fi adapter driver doesn’t help, try running the Network Adapter troubleshooter. This troubleshooter can help diagnose and fix problems with your wireless and other network adapters. To run the troubleshooter:

1. On your taskbar, select the**Start** button and click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/windows11-start-settings.jpg)
2. Under System, select**Troubleshoot** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/win11-troubleshoot.jpg)
3. Click**Other troubleshooters** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/win11-other-troubleshooter.jpg)
4. Scroll down the page, locate**Network Adapter** and click**Run** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/win11-network-adapter-run.jpg)
5. Follow the steps in the troubleshooter and see if that fixes the problem.

If your issue persists, check out the next fix.

### Fix 5: Turn on WLAN AutoConfig service

 WLAN AutoConfig is a Windows service that helps your computer to configure, discover, connect to, and disconnect from a wireless network. If this service is disabled, your Wi-Fi won’t work. So you should make sure the WLAN AutoConfig service is running automatically. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together to invoke the Run dialog. Then type**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/windows11-services.jpg)
2. Find**WLAN AutoConfig** in the list of services, right-click on it and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wlan-autoconfig-properties.jpg)
3. Make sure**Startup type** is set to**Automatic** and**Service status** is**Running** . Then click**OK** to save changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wlan-autoconfig-startup-type.jpg)

Restart your PC and see if your Wi-Fi shows up.

If you still face the same issue, try the next fix.

### Fix 6: Run network commands

 When you’re having trouble with your wireless network, you can try running some network commands to manually reset the TCP/IP stack, release and renew the IP address, and flush and reset the DNS client resolver cache. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog. Then type**cmd** and press**Ctrl** ,**Shift,** and**Enter** simultaneously to run**Command Prompt** as administrator.
