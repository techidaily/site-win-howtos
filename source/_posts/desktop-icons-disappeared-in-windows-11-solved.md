![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wifi-missing.jpg)

 Some Windows 11 users have reported that the Wi-Fi option is missing or not showing up in their taskbar. If you’re facing the same problem, don’t worry. Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Power cycle your computer](#Fix1)**
2. **[Enable the Wi-Fi adapter](#Fix2)**
3. **[Update your Wi-Fi adapter driver](#Fix3)**
4. **[Run the Network Adapter troubleshooter](#Fix4)**
5. **[Turn on WLAN AutoConfig service](#Fix5)**
6. **[Run network commands](#Fix6)**
7. **[Reset your network](#Fix7)**

### Fix1: Power cycle your computer

 The Wi-Fi option missing issue could be caused by a random bug on your Windows 11 PC. To fix the problem, **try to shut down your system, wait a few minutes, and then boot it again** . It sounds simple but does work for many users.

If you haven’t tried this method before, give it a go.

### Fix 2: Enable the Wi-Fi adapter

 If your Wi-Fi adapter is disabled, the Wi-Fi option may not show up. To see if that’s the case, you can check your network settings. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog. Then type**ncpa.cpl** and click**OK** .

 Once done, restart your computer and check if your Wi-Fi network shows up again.

 If your Wi-Fi adapter is enabled and the issue remains, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your Wi-Fi adapter driver

 **One of the main causes of the Wi-Fi option not showing up is that you’re using a corrupted or outdated wireless adapter driver.** To ensure your Wi-Fi network works properly, you need to update your Wi-Fi adapter driver to the latest version.

 You can go to the manufacturer’s website, search for the latest driver for your wireless network adapter, and then download and install it manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 Or click the**Update** button to download the latest wireless adapter driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Now check to see if your problem has been resolved. If not, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Run the Network Adapter troubleshooter

 If updating the Wi-Fi adapter driver doesn’t help, try running the Network Adapter troubleshooter. This troubleshooter can help diagnose and fix problems with your wireless and other network adapters. To run the troubleshooter:

1. On your taskbar, select the**Start** button and click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/windows11-start-settings.jpg)
2. Under System, select**Troubleshoot** .

5. Follow the steps in the troubleshooter and see if that fixes the problem.

If your issue persists, check out the next fix.

### Fix 5: Turn on WLAN AutoConfig service

 WLAN AutoConfig is a Windows service that helps your computer to configure, discover, connect to, and disconnect from a wireless network. If this service is disabled, your Wi-Fi won’t work. So you should make sure the WLAN AutoConfig service is running automatically. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together to invoke the Run dialog. Then type**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/windows11-services.jpg)
2. Find**WLAN AutoConfig** in the list of services, right-click on it and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wlan-autoconfig-properties.jpg)
3. Make sure**Startup type** is set to**Automatic** and**Service status** is**Running** . Then click**OK** to save changes.

Restart your PC and see if your Wi-Fi shows up.

If you still face the same issue, try the next fix.

### Fix 6: Run network commands

 When you’re having trouble with your wireless network, you can try running some network commands to manually reset the TCP/IP stack, release and renew the IP address, and flush and reset the DNS client resolver cache. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog. Then type**cmd** and press**Ctrl** ,**Shift,** and**Enter** simultaneously to run**Command Prompt** as administrator.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/windows11-cmd.jpg)
2. If you are prompted for permission by User Account Control, click**Yes** .

3. At the command prompt, type**netsh winsock reset** and press**Enter** .

4. Type**netsh int ip reset** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ip-reset.jpg)
5. Type**ipconfig /release** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ip-release.jpg)
6. Then type**ipconfig /renew** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ip-renew.jpg)
7. Type**ipconfig /flushdns** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ip-flushdns.jpg)

 Once you’ve run all those commands, restart your computer and try to connect to the Wi-Fi network.

If this method doesn’t help, try the last fix below.

### Fix 7: Reset your network

 If you’ve tried all of the above steps and you still can’t get your Wi-Fi to work, the last thing you can try is to reset your network. This will remove and then reinstall all your network adapters and the settings for them will be set to the defaults. To do so:

1. On your taskbar, select the**Start** button and click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/windows11-start-settings.jpg)
2. Select**Network & internet** , then click**Advanced network settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/windows11-advanced-network-settings.jpg)
3. Under More settings, click**Network reset** .

5. Click**Yes** to confirm again.
