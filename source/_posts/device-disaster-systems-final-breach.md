1. Press**Windows + X** keys to open the quick access menu and select**Device Manager** .

## Fix 2: Add the touchpad driver back manually

 If you know the manufacturer of your touchpad (Synaptics and Elan are two of the most popular ones), you can also try to add the touchpad device back manually in Device Manager to see if it works for you. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **X** at the same time. Then select **Device Manager** .

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Show-All-Devices.png)
6. As mentioned, two of the most popular touchpad manufacturers are**Elan** and**Synaptics** , so you can select one of them on the**Manufacturer** list on the left side, and then see if you can find the touchpad device on the right side. Sometimes, you may also need to check if your touchpad is listed under the**Microsoft** umbrella. You can also try your laptop manufacturer’s name, like Acer, Asus, HP Dell, etc., to see if your touchpad is listed under them.

 If you still can’t find your touchpad in this way, please move on to the next fix, below.

## Fix 3: Update the touchpad driver

 As you may have known, this problem may occur if you are using the wrong touchpad driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your touchpad driver to see if it fixes your problem. In the condition that the Device Manager can’t work for you, there are two other ways you can update your touchpad driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](#option-1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (recommended)](#option-2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 To get the driver of your touchpad, you need to go to the official website of your device’s brand, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32-bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

## Fix 4: Configure the BIOS settings

 Whenever your computer is booted, the BIOS is the first to be activated for operating system loading and device data reading. For some reason, your touchpad may be disabled in the BIOS and therefore can’t be displayed in Device Manager. So you might need to check your BIOS and set it to default. Here’s how:

1. Restart your PC and keep**pressing the assigned BIOS hotkey** ( table below for your reference) as soon as you see the Windows logo on the screen to enter the BIOS settings.

| ASUS                      | F2 for all PCs, F2 or DEL for motherboards |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Dell                      | F2 or F12                                  |
| HP                        | ESC or F10                                 |
| Lenovo                    | F2 or Fn + F2                              |
| Lenovo (Desktops)         | F1                                         |
| Lenovo (ThinkPads)        | Enter + F1.                                |
| Microsoft Surface Tablets | Press and hold the volume up button        |
| Samsung:                  | F2                                         |
| Sony                      | F1, F2, or F3                              |

Assigned BIOS hotkey

1. After entering the BIOS, find the option that allows you to restore the BIOS under the**Security** tab or the**Exit** tab.  
**Note:** Depending on what motherboard you have, the name of the option allowing you to restore the BIOS could be**Reset to Default** ,**Load Factory Defaults** ,**Load Setup Defaults** ,**Load Optimized Defaults** , etc.
2. Select**Yes** in the window for confirmation.

3. Once done, press the key next to**Save** and**Exit** .
4. Restart your computer to see if the issue is fixed.

 If this method doesn’t work, then try the last one below.

## Fix 5: Repair corrupt files

 If none of the above fixes work for you, you might want to consider**a holistic scan for a file check** on your PC. Because if your computer has corrupted system files or critical system files missing, your touchpad also won’t function properly.

 To save you from labor, we recommend[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to help you repair corrupt files. Fortect is a powerful tool that is tailored to your specific system and operates privately and automatically.
