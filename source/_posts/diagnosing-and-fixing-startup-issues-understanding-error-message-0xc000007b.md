**[Fix 1: Run system file checker](#fix1)**

**[Fix 2: Verify integrity of game files](#fix2)**

### Fix 1: Run system file checker

 Missing or damaged system files may lead to your PUBG-not-launching issue. If that’s the case, you can use the system file checker tool of Windows to check for any file corruption and thereby repair it.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows Logo Key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box. Type **cmd** and press **Ctrl+Shift+Enter**  to run Command Prompt as administrator.

 2) When prompted for permission to make changes to your device, click**Yes** .

 3) In the pop-up window of Command Prompt, enter the following command (**note** that there’s a space between**sfc and /** ):

sfc /scannow

 After you finish typing the command, hit**Enter** on your keyboard. Then the sfc tool will begin to scan all system files and repair the corrupted or missing ones.

4) Wait for the verification to complete.

 Windows Support provides more depth on the system file checker tool at  
**[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system)** [](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system)

 Now that your system files have been repaired, try to launch PUBG and see if the problem still remains. If so, please proceed to the next fix.

 In case your problem hasn’t been solved successfully, you may move on to the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Disable unsupported programs

 Unsupported programs are among the most common causes of games-not-launching issues. This is also true with PUBG. To solve the problem, you need to remove or disable any programs unrelated to the game, and even turn off your antivirus temporarily.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows Logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type in **taskmgr** and hit **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-296.png)

 2) Select the**Processes** tab. Right-click on the program that needs to be ended and click**End task** . If you don’t know which program should be shut down, simply close all the background running apps that you think are unnecessary.**Note** that you shouldn’t end any processes that you’re not familiar with in case you mistakenly close the important ones.

 As reported by many PUBG players,**MSI Afterburner** – an overclocking tool for MSI graphics cards – may be one of the culprits for the trouble. If you happen to be using this app, make sure you turn if off.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-13_10-51-43.png)

 If you find out any programs that trigger the issue, you can forward them to **[PUBG support](https://www.pubg.com/support/)**  .

 3) Your trouble is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily**disable your antivirus program** and check if the PUBG-not-launching issue persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If the game works properly after you disable the antivirus, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If this didn’t help, please try out the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **Fix 5: Update your device drivers**

 Make sure you have the latest drivers for your PC components (such as CPU, GPU, and audio). Sometimes PUBG may fail to be launched because of an out-dated or corrupt driver, which is so inconspicuous that you may not even notice it until the problem occurs. If that’s the case, try to update your device drivers periodically.

 You may either download the most up-to-date drivers online and install them manually, or simply trust in **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and its abilities to update all your drivers automatically.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy takes care of everything.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE**  or the **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-96.png)

 3) Click the **Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download the correct version of the driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version). Then install the driver in your computer.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-97.png)

 If you have any problems when using Driver Easy, please feel free to drop us an email at <support@drivereasy.com>. We are always here if we can help.

### Fix 6: Reinstall PUBG

 If all the fixes above can’t help you solve the problem, then you should try to reinstall PUBG in case some of its crucial files have been corrupted. Here’s how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows Logo**  key and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type in **control panel** and press **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-20_10-55-05.png)

 2) Expand the drop-down list next to**View by:** and select **Category** . Then, click **Uninstall a program** right under the **Programs** category.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-750.png)

 3) Right-click on PUBG and click**Uninstall** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-481.png)

4) Follow the on-screen instructions to uninstall PUBG.

5) Download and install PUBG from Steam once again. Then try to launch the game and see if your problem still remains.
