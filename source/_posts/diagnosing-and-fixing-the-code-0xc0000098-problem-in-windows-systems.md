 Access violation error occurs when the program you try to run is attempting to reach a location that is not assigned for it. This can result from various reasons. You can try the methods below to troubleshoot this error.

**a)**  First, you should run your**security software** to**scan out malicious programs** . Viruses or malware on your computer (if any) can affect your system and cause the 0xc0000005 error. You should run a virus scan before going to any further troubleshooting.

**b)** You can also disable**Data Execution Prevention (DEP)** for the program that has the problem. DEP is a built-in feature on Windows for protecting your computer. But some programs are not compatible with this feature and opening it will cause 0xc0000005 error.

 To**disable** it:

**i.** Log in your Windows as Administrator;

**ii.** Press**Win + R** and then enter “_**sysdm.cpl**_ “;
