## Wireless Mouse Stops Working Randomly? Fix It in Windows 11 and Windows 10 With These Tips

Your wireless mouse may randomly stop working. This is annoying. But don’t worry, I have prepared a set of solutions for you to solve it.

## Why does your wireless mouse randomly stop working?

 The reasons the wireless mouse randomly stops working can be different. But figuring out reasons is the first step to fix it. Here, I summarize the following factors that may cause your mouse problems:

* Low battery power
* Damaged mouse
* Connectivity problems resulting from Bluetooth and USB port
* Missing or outdated drivers
* Realtek HD Audio Manager
* Disappearing cursor feature
* System files issues
* Hard errors

 You don’t need to worry too much about the above reasons but just try the methods below to fix it.

## Before getting started

 Before you get started to fix the mouse problem, it is a wise choice to check your wireless mouse first.

### Check the power of the wireless mouse

 When the battery is emptied, your mouse will randomly stop moving. Therefore, you have to check the power of the mouse. For battery-powered wireless mouse, you can just replace the batteries and check if it works. Or if you use a rechargeable wireless mouse, charge it and check if it works.

### Check if the wireless mouse is damaged

 As time goes, your wireless mouse is consumed. As a result, it may be damaged. Especially, a cheap mouse may have a shorter service time. When your mouse doesn’t work, you can check if your mouse has been damaged. You can connect your mouse to another PC and see if the mouse works. Once it doesn’t work, just replace it with a new one.

### Method 1: Change USB port

 Your wireless mouse may come with a USB receiver. Generally, you can plug the USB receiver into a USB port on your PC and then your mouse can work. If your USB receiver is plugged into a USB port but it does not work, it may be due to the USB port. You can just try another USB port.

1. Unplug the USB receiver from your PC.
2. Plug the USB receiver into another USB port and see if it works.

### Method 2: Add a Bluetooth device

 It’s possible that your mouse works normally but it hasn’t paired with your PC. If your mouse doesn’t connect to your computer via the USB receiver, you can do it manually by adding a Bluetooth device.

1. On the keyboard, press the **Windows** logo key and **I** key at the same time to Open **Settings** .
2. Click**Devices** from the menu options.
