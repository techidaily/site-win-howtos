1. **[Check the hardware](#Method1)**
2. **[Update your sound card driver](#Method4)**

## **Method 1: Check the hardware**

 If others can’t hear you in the party chat, but you can hear them clearly, please check these possibilities below to troubleshoot your problem.

### **Check your headset**

 First of all, you need to check your headset’s cables and ports to see if they are working properly.

 Make sure that you**correctly plug the cables into the appropriate ports** . Make sure there are **no dust or obstacles** inside the ports that may prevent your device from working properly.

### **Check your mic boom**

 You may need to troubleshoot whether your problem lies in your headset with mic boom, so follow these two steps:

 1) Check**whether your mic boom is not loose** . Unplug your headset from your PS4 controller, then  disconnect the mic boom by pulling it straight out of the headset and plug the mic boom back in. Then re-plug your headset into your PS4 controller again.

 2)**Try your PS4 headset with a** mic on another device to see if it works normally. For example, plug your headset into your mobile phone, make a phone call with your mic, and see if it works well.

 If your headset and microphone are working normally, skip to[**method 2**](#Method4) .

 If your headset and microphone are not working well, it could be an issue with your mic boom, so you may need to replace it with a new mic boom. Or you can try this non-official but effective solution (this works for many users):

1) Connect your PS4 headset with mic into the PS4 controller.

2) Unplug your microphone halfway out from your controller, and plug it back in. Repeat this more than twice until you hear a sound like a buzz.

3) Try your PS4 mic again to see if it works.

## **Method 2: Update your sound card driver**

**Manually update audio driver** – You should go to the website of your mic manufacturer, find the correct and latest sound driver for your device, and install it on your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

 4) After updating the driver, restart your computer, then try your PS4 mic and see if your problem is solved.

## **Method 3: Check the PS4 settings**

 If you are sure that there is no problem with your mic boom and headset, it seems like an issue with your PS4 settings. Check the following steps to make sure that the PS4 settings are configured correctly.

 1) Go to the  **PS4** **Settings**  \>  **Devices**  \>  **Audio Devices** .

If your mic can be detected on the   **Adjust Microphone Level**   screen, then the headset and mic are working with the PS4 properly. If your mic was not detected on the  **Adjust Microphone Level**  screen, continue to  [**Method 4**](#Method3) .

## **Method 4: Check the audio settings on your PC**

 To check your microphone,**plug your microphone into another computer** that works properly, and see if your microphone works or not. If your mic still doesn’t work, then it should be a problem with your mic, and you should replace it with a new one; if your mic works on the new computer, it should be a problem with your audio settings, then check the following settings:

## Method 5: Replace with a PS4 microphone

 You can try using your microphone on other devices, like another PlayStation 4, or your PC, and see if it works or not. If it turns out that your microphone stops working, you’ll need to replace it with a new PS4 microphone.

 You can buy a new microphone to play PS4 games on the Internet. Be sure to choose a **[microphone](https://www.amazon.com/VersionTECH-Surround-Over-Ear-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B012DFI02O/ref=sr%5F1%5F4?ie=UTF8&qid=1541673913&sr=8-4&keywords=ps4+mic&tag=easeware-lillianlai-20)**  with high quality and reasonable price.
