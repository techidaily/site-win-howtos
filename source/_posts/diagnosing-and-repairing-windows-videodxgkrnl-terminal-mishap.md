### Fix 5: Remove klhkum.dll

 If you have to reset Winsock tens of times a day, you need to try this method. What you should do is checking whether you have “klhkum.dll” or not.

 klhkum.dll’s description is “**System Interceptors PDK usermode service interceptor** ” and it’s intercepting the system when it shouldn’t.  
 So how to remove it? Follow the guide:

1. Press**Ctrl+Shift+Esc** to open the Task Manager.
2. Click the**Startup** tab and find**klhkum.dll** process.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2020-03-31_18-52-10.jpg)
3. Right-click on it and choose**Disable** . You can also open its file location and delete it permanently.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2020-03-31_18-55-36.jpg)
4. Restart your computer to see if the error has gone.

 One more tip: If you’re using Kaspersky security software and possibly on Windows 7, you need to turn off Kaspersky manually to fix the issue.
