![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_595b0a627401c.png)Feel the brightness not proper on your Windows 10 screen? No change when you adjust it via brightness control? No annoyance anymore! Here’s the guide to tell you how to fix the**brightness not working issue on Windows 10** . Read on and find out how. In general, your brightness control not working issue is due to the display driver. Here are two solutions you can try:

1. **[Update your display driver](#s1)**
2. [**Use the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter software**](#s2)

## Solution 1: Update your display driver

There are two ways you can update your display driver : manually or automatically. **Manual driver update –** You can update your display driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your display card  , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version. **Automatic driver update –** If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your display driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact display card, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b8cf975d05c.jpg)
