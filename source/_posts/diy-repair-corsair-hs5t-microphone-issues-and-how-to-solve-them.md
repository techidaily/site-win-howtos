### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

To do so:

1. Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .

### Fix 4: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 If none of the fixes works for you, it’s time to check for potential hardware issues.

You can follow the steps below to narrow down and troubleshoot:

1. Connect your microphone device to **another port**  on your laptop. If the mic works in the other port, it suggests this issue is probably caused by a faulty port, if your mic still doesn’t work, move on to**2)** , below.
2. Connect your microphone device to **another computer** . If your mic works in another PC, you should contact the vendor of your laptop for advice; if your mic still doesn’t work in another PC,  you should contact the vendor of your microphone device for support.
