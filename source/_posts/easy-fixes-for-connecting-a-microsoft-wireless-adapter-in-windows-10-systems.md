2. [**Install all Windows updates**](#fix2)

### Fix 1: Reinstall your Bluetooth driver

 In most cases, the AirPods not connecting issue indicates that you’re using a**broken or outdated Bluetooth driver** . To fix this, the easiest and quickest way is to reinstall the Bluetooth driver on your PC.

To do so, first you need to uninstall the Bluetooth driver:

1. On your keyboard, press **Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste **devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

2. In the pop-up window, double-click **Bluetooth** to expand the category. Then right-click your Bluetooth adapter and select **Uninstall device** . (If you don’t see a Bluetooth adapter, try using [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to scan for missing drivers.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/device-manager-uninstall-bluetooth-driver.jpg)  
 To identify the Bluetooth adapter, one common method is to look for the name that**starts with a manufacturer** (e.g. Intel, Qualcomm or Realtek) and**ends with a “Bluetooth”** .
3. In the pop-up window, check the box next to **Delete the driver software for this device** . Then click **Uninstall** .

4. Once you’ve uninstalled your Bluetooth driver, restart your PC for the changes to apply.

 To address Bluetooth issues and maximize the performance of your AirPods, you need**the latest Bluetooth driver** for your computer.

 Normally Windows will install the Bluetooth driver automatically after a reboot. But that’s not always the case. And you also need to**make sure the Bluetooth driver is the latest** .

 Generally, there’re 2 ways you can install the latest Bluetooth driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Install the latest Bluetooth driver manually

 If you’re familiar with your computer hardware, you can try to install the latest Bluetooth driver manually. First you can visit the official website of your motherboard manufacturer, then search for your exact model. Usually you’ll find the drivers in the support page. Be sure to download the latest installer that’s compatible with your operating system.

#### Option 2: Install the latest Bluetooth driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
