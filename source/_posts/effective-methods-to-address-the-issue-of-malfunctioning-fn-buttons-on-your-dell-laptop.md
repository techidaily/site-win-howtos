## Method 1: Press Fn + Esc on your keyboard

 This method is very simple. Just press Fn + Esc on your keyboard. It has worked for some Dell laptop users. Why not have a try?

## Method 2: Update Related Drivers

 The problem is not just caused by keyboard drivers. It could be due to other driver issues like chipset driver issues and display driver issues. If Method 1 doesn’t resolve the problem, try to update the drivers. Go to Dell’s website to check for the latest drivers of your laptop.

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update** button next to one driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
