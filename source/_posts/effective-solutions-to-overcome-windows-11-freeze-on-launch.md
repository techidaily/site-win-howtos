### Fix 3: Update your network card driver

 This problem could be also due to an old network card driver.  You can update your network card driver manually or, if you’re not confident playing around with drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b0e8904a209.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to all the flagged drivers to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the **FREE** version).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b2095b8135c.jpg)
