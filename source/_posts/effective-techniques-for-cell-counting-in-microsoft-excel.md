 Excel provides various methods for [counting cells](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-cryptic-collection-of-2023-auction-for-anonymity-artifacts/) including using the Find feature or a filter. But with functions, you can count exactly what you need. From filled cells to blanks, from numbers to text, here's how to count cells in Excel.

##  Count Cells With Numbers: The COUNT Function

 If you want to count the number of cells that contain only numbers, you can use [the COUNT function](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-a-lost-xiaomi-redmi-note-12t-pro-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). The syntax for the formula is:

        `COUNT(value1, value2,...)`
    
 where `value1` is required and `value2` is optional.

 You'll use `value1` for your cell references, the range of cells you want to count within. You can use `value2` (and subsequent arguments) to add a particular number or another cell range if you like. Let's look at a couple of examples.

 To count the number of cells in the range A1 through D7 that contains numbers, you would type the following and hit Enter:

=COUNT(A1:D7)

![COUNT formula in Excel](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CountFormula-ExcelCountCells.png) 

 You then receive the result in the cell containing the formula.

 To count the number of cells in two separate ranges B2 through B7 and D2 through D7 that contain numbers, you would type the following and press Enter:

=COUNT(B2:B7,D2:D7)

![COUNT formula for ranges](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CountRangesFormula-ExcelCountCells.png) 

 Now you'll see the total count of numbers for both of those cell ranges.

##  Count Blank Cells: The COUNTBLANK Function

 Maybe what you want to find is the number of blank cells you have in a particular range. You'll use a variation of the COUNT function, COUNTBLANK. The syntax for the formula is: `COUNTBLANK(value1)` where `value1` contains the cell references and is required.

 To count the number of blank cells in the range A2 through C11, you would type the following and press Enter:

=COUNTBLANK(A2:C11)

![COUNTBLANK formula in Excel](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CountBlankFormula-ExcelCountCells.png)

 You'll then see the result in the cell where you entered the formula.

##  Count Nonblank Cells: The COUNTA Function

 Perhaps you'd like to do the exact opposite of counting cells that are blank and instead count cells that contain data. In this case, you would use the COUNTA function. The syntax is `COUNTA(value1, value2,...)` where `value1` is required and `value2` is optional.

 Just like [the COUNT function above](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-techniques-to-transfer-data-from-oneplus-ace-2v-to-iphone-15141312-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/), `value1` is for your cell references and `value2` is for additional ranges you want to include.

 To count the number of nonblank cells in the range A2 through C11, you would type the following and hit Enter:

=COUNTA(A2:C11)

![COUNTA formula in Excel](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CountAFormula-ExcelCountCells.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 As you can see, the COUNTA function counts cells containing any type of data. This includes numbers, text, errors, and empty text or strings. For example, the error in cell C7 is counted.

##  Count Cells With Specific Criteria: The COUNTIF Function

 If you would like to count the number of cells containing specific data, you would use the COUNTIF function. The syntax for the formula is `COUNTIF(value1, criteria)` where both `value1` and `criteria` are required.

 Like the other functions here, `value1` contains the cell references for the range. `Criteria` is the item you want to search for and can be a cell reference, word, number, or wildcard. Let's look at a couple of basic examples.

 To count the number of cells in the range C2 through C6 that contain the word "socks," you would type the following and press Enter:

=COUNTIF(C2:C6,"socks")

![COUNTIF text formula in Excel](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CountIfFormulaText-ExcelCountCells.png) 

 Notice that if your criterion is a word, you must surround it in double quotes.

![COUNTIF text result](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CountIfResultText-ExcelCountCells.png) 

 To count the number of cells in the range B2 through C6 that contain what's in cell B2, you would type the following and press Enter:

=COUNTIF(B2:C6,B2)

![COUNTIF cell reference formula in Excel](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CountIfFormulaRef-ExcelCountCells.png) 

 In this case, you would not place the B2 cell reference in double quotes.
