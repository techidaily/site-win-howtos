## Fix 3: Update your wireless network adapter driver

 This problem could be also caused by an old or incorrect wireless network adapter driver on your computer. If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually,  you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 This process requires network access on your computer. You can connect your computer to the wired network or you can use the **[Offline Scan](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  feature of Driver Easy to update drivers.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE**   or the **Pro**   version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_5975bf182a016.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to a flagged network adapter driver to automatically download it， then you can install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/5-25.jpg)
