 If you’re overclocking your CPU or GPU, you need to set your CPU / GPU clock speed back to normal. Then restart your PC to see if this issue works for you.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Corrupted or outdated graphics drivers may trigger Error 0x887A0006\. To fix this issue, you need to update your graphics driver to the latest version. Updating your graphics driver to the latest version can make your game run smoother and prevent many issues or errors.
