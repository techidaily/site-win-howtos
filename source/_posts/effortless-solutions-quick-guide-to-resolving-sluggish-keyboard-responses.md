### Fix 2: Stop overclocking your GPU

 Overlocking the GPU is a good method to try if you wish for a faster and smoother game performance. But pushing it too high may cause the game crashing issue.

 If you ever overlocked you GPU and encounter the CS:GO crashing issue,  
 you can try lowering it back to the default setting. If not, or it doesn’t help with the situation, you should try **Fix 3** .

 1) In Steam, go to**LIBRARY** .

 2) In your list of games, locate and right-click on **Counter -Strike: Global Offensive** in your list of games and click **Properties** .
