 Do you want to find and optionally delete the duplicate entries in your spreadsheets? If so, use [Microsoft Excel's conditional formatting](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-asmr-video-insights/) option to highlight duplicates and then select an option to remove those items. We'll show you how.

 To find the duplicates, use conditional formatting that checks the duplicate values in your cells and highlights them in [your chosen formatting](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-9-asus-rog-phone-7-monitoring-apps-for-parental-controls-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). Then, optionally, you can ask Excel to remove all duplicates from your dataset, keeping only the unique values in it.

##  Highlight Duplicate Values in Excel

 To highlight non-unique values, first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 In the spreadsheet, select the dataset which you want to check for duplicates. Make sure to include the [column headers in your selection](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-decoding-the-best-android-photography-software-is-picku-king-for-2024/).

![Select the dataset.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1-select-dataset.png) 

 From Excel's ribbon at the top, select the "Home" tab. Then, in the "Styles" section, choose Conditional Formatting > Highlight Cells Rules > Duplicate Values.

![Use conditional formatting.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2-highlight-duplicate-values.png) 

 You'll see a "Duplicate Values" box. Here, click the first drop-down menu and choose "Duplicate." Select the second drop-down menu and pick the formatting you want to use to highlight the duplicate entries. To use custom formatting, choose "Custom Format."

 Then, click "OK."

![Customize formatting options and click "OK."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/3-customize-duplicate-formatting.png) 

 On your spreadsheet, you'll find that [Excel has highlighted](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-iphone-12-pro-asking-for-passcode-after-ios-1714-update-what-to-do-by-drfone-ios/) the duplicate entries in your selected formatting style.
