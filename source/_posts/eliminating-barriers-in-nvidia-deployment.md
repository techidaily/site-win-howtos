## Fix 1: Make sure your video card is supported by WoW

 When you see the unable to start up 3D acceleration in WoW, the first thing you should do is to make sure that your video card is supported by World of Warcraft. Here’s the list for your reference:[https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/31372](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/31372)

 If your video card is not on the list, it’s probably that your video card doesn’t even meet the minimum system requirements for WoW to run. In that case, you’ll need to upgrade your hardware device for the game to run properly.

 If your computer meets the system requirements, but the unable to start up 3D acceleration error remains, please move on.

## Fix 2: Run your game as an administrator

 Running WoW as admin has been working well for many WOW players who have the unable to start up 3D acceleration error. To see if this does the trick for you:

1. Go to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\, right-click the World of Warcraft
2. File Explorer opens. Right click on your**game.exe file** , and click**Properties** .

3. Click the**Compatibility** tab, and check the box next to**Run this program as an administrator** , then click**Apply** and**OK** to save your changes.

## Fix 6: Ensure that your monitor is plugged into the correct output

 This is actually not uncommon, plugging your monitor into the wrong video output could also lead to the **3d acceleration is not supported**  error in WoW. If you have an external monitor for your laptop, or if you have more than one monitor, always make sure that the cables and the video outputs are all setup correctly.
