 Every time you open a Microsoft Office application, you have to wait for the splash screen to disappear. If you want this to go away, here's how you can disable the startup screen.

 Note: Since we are creating a shortcut this will only disable the splash screens when creating a new document, but it will not be disabled when you open a document by double-clicking on it.

 This guide assumes you have the x86 version of Office 2010 installed on a x64 edition of Windows. However if your configuration is different you can find the files to create shortcuts to in the following locations:

**x86 Office on x86 Windows** 

> C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office14

**x64 Office on x64 Windows** 

> C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office14

 Just remember if your binaries are in a different location, you mustn't forget to add the switch to the end of the shortcut or it wont work
