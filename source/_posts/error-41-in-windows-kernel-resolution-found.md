## Method 5: Update your drivers

 The kernel32.dll error may be caused by corrupted hardware drivers. Updating drivers not only fix the error but also improves your computer performance.  
 There are two ways you can get the right drivers: manually or automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](#op1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 –** Download and install the driver manually

 Devices keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Automatically update drivers

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making mistakes when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## Method 6: Check your system memory

2. Clean your RAM if it’s dusty. And don’t forget the RAM slot

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**The result can lead to two situations:**

**A** : Your RAM has no problem. Then move to the next method.

**B** : The test result indicated that the computer suffers from a bad memory. You should replace your RAM with a new one.  
 Then restart your computer and check to see the Kernel32.dll error will appear or not.

## Method 7: Repair hard disk errors

 In some cases, the kernel32.dll error could be attributed to hard drive corruption.  
**Check Disk Utility(chkdsk.exe)** is a useful tool offered by Windows that can be used to check the hard drive for bad sectors and fix them if possible.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and **R** key at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type “cmd” and press **Shift+Ctrl+Enter** together to open **Command Prompt** in the administrator mode.  
**Note** : Do **NOT** click OK or just press the Enter key as that won’t allow you to open Command Prompt in the administrator mode.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/command-prompt-1.jpg)
3. Type the following command line and press the **Enter** key on your keyboard.

**chkdsk x: /f**
