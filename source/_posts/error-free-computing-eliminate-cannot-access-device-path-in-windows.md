## **Solution 2: Update the graphics driver**

 Your problem may be caused by a graphics driver issue. This can happen if the Windows basic video driver is installed but not the manufacturer’s driver.  So try to update your graphics driver to fix the problem.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your video card: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your video drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your video card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your video card, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly. Here;s what you need to do:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged video driver driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the **FREE** version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **Pro** version which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
