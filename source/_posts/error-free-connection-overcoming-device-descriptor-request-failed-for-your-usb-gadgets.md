3. Double-click**Universal Serial Bus controllers** . Then**right-click** on every device listed there and select**Uninstall device** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b9f7575e979a.jpg)
4. Once you uninstall all your USB controllers, restart your computer. Once your system reboots, it will reinstall your USB controllers automatically. Then check to see if the error disappears.

### Method 3: Update your USB controller driver

 If both the methods above fails to help, you may need to**update your USB controller driver** .

 You can update your USB controller driver either manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your USB controller driver manually by going to the**manufacturer’s website** for your brand computer or motherboard, and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose the only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows system.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your USB controller driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your USB controller, and your variant of Windows system, and it will download and install it correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b9f7c09b2a28.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support** and a**30-day money back** guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  
 Note: You can do it**for free** if you like, but it’s partly manual.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b9f7b31a785d.jpg)
