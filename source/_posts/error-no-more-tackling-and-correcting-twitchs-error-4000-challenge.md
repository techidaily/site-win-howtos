### Fix 3: Update your monitor driver and graphics card driver

 The missing or corrupted device drivers (especially the monitor driver and graphics card driver) will cause the “Input Not Supported” error on monitors. So you should update these drivers in your computer.

**Note** : you’ll need to log into Windows to perform these steps. If you can’t log into your computer, boot your computer into**Safe Mode** and then follow the instructions.

 There are two ways to update drivers:**manually** and**automatically** :

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the manufacturer’s website of your device, find the latest version for the driver, then download and install it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged monitor and graphics card to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install it in your computer.  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
