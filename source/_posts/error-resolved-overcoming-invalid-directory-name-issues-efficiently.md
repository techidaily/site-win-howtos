![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ab9e09904.jpg)

Having an error on Destiny 2 saying:**Destiny 2 servers are not available**? Don’t worry. This is a common Destiny server issue and you can fix servers not available in Destiny 2\. Why is Destiny 2 server unavailable? It’s very likely that too many people connect to the servers at the same time period, and the servers are overloading. So you can’t currently connect to the server and get the servers unavailable error. In addition, the network problems in your computer can also result in the error. But the good news is, this is not a difficult issue to resolve.

### Fix 3: Use the Ethernet connection

It’s recommended to use the Ethernet connection, since playing games like Destiny 2 requires a more stable and faster Internet connection. So you can switch to the**Ethernet connection**on your computer to see if it works. If you want to use the WiFi connection, or there’s no Ethernet connection available, try these steps to force your computer (and Destiny 2 included) to connect via WiFi.

1. Right click on the**network icon** at the bottom right corner on your desktop, and click**Open Network and Sharing Center** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f04abb90727.png) If you don’t see “**Open Network and Sharing Center** ” there, you can click**Open Network and Internet settings** , then click**Network and Sharing Center** in**Settings** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ade913312.png) ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ae1eb2cb9.jpg)
2. Click**Change adapter settings** on the left.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ae4f8eabf.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9b0540f4ac.jpg)
