### Tip 3: Run System File Checker

 As Internet Explorer is a built-in browser, corrupted system files could cause IE not responding properly. Then you can use **System File Scanner**  to run a scan.

**System File Checker** will inspect all of the important Windows files on your PC. If the Checker finds an issue with any of these protected files, it will replace it.

1. Type **cmd**   in the Windows search box.
2. **Right-click**  on **Command Prompt**  and select **Run as administrator**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b97754fa8fce.jpg)
3. Click **Yes**  at the **User Account Control** prompt.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b97756bba070.jpg)
4. Once Command Prompt is open, type the **sfc /scannow**  command and press **Enter**  on your keyboard.  
**Note:**  There’s a space between **sfc**  and **/scannow**  .
