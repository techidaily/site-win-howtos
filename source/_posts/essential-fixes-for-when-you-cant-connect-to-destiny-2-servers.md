<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Tip 3: Run System File Checker

 As Internet Explorer is a built-in browser, corrupted system files could cause IE not responding properly. Then you can use **System File Scanner**  to run a scan.

**System File Checker** will inspect all of the important Windows files on your PC. If the Checker finds an issue with any of these protected files, it will replace it.

1. Type **cmd**   in the Windows search box.
2. **Right-click**  on **Command Prompt**  and select **Run as administrator**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b97754fa8fce.jpg)
3. Click **Yes**  at the **User Account Control** prompt.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b97756bba070.jpg)
4. Once Command Prompt is open, type the **sfc /scannow**  command and press **Enter**  on your keyboard.

**Note:**  There’s a space between **sfc**  and **/scannow**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b977592dab5b.jpg)
5. When the verification reaches 100%, you’ll see something like this if issues were found and corrected:  
 **Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them.**  
 If that’s the case, restart your PC.
6. Check if you can open IE normally.

### Tip 4: Disable your security software

 It could also be possible that some piece of your security or antivirus software, say,Trusteer Rapport,  is causing the problem. Try disabling or uninstalling it to fix the issue, as it worked for some users. Here’s how to disable security software:

1. Right-click on the Taskbar and select**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b977d9f3f6d2.jpg)
2. Click the**Startup** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b977dc8cdc2e.png)
3. Select the program(s) you want to disable and click the**Disable** button in the bottom right corner. Then, IE should open normally.

### Tip 5: **Restore your system to a restore point**

 If none of the above works, you may try using System Restore to undo system changes and sort out the issue. Following are steps of how to restore your system to a restore point.

1. Type **restore** in the Windows search box and select **Create a restore point**  or **System Restore** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b977ba6da9ba.jpg)
2. When the **System Restore**  window pops up, select **Choose a different restore point**  and click **Next**  .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b977bc3e7e53.jpg)
3. **Check**  the box beside **Show more restore points**  , and select a point in time when you remember IE was last working properly, then click   **Next.**

## Bonus tip

 If the driver for your network adapter is faulty or outdated, it could cause other problems when you’re visiting a website on your Internet Explorer. Just to be on the safe side, you should make sure your network adapter driver is up to date.

 If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b9785a75eb28.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to your network adapter driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).
