 You may [hide columns, rows, or cells in Excel](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-tips-and-tricks-for-apple-id-locked-issue-from-apple-iphone-6-by-drfone-ios/) to make data entry or analysis easier. But when you copy and paste a cell range with hidden cells, they suddenly reappear, don't they?

 You might not realize it, but there is a way to copy and paste only the visible cells in Microsoft Excel. It takes nothing more than a few clicks.

##  Default Copy and Paste With Hidden Cells in Excel

 By default, when you copy a cell range in Excel that contains hidden cells, those hidden cells display when you paste.

 As an example, we've hidden rows 3 through 12 (February through November) in the following screenshot.

 When we select the visible cell range, use the Copy action, and then Paste, those hidden cells appear.

 Start by [selecting the cells](https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-a-ravaged-world-on-motorcycle-in-days-gone-our-comprehhavis-review/) you want to copy and paste. Then, head to the Home tab and click the Find & Select (magnifying glass) drop-down arrow. Choose "Go To Special."

 With the cells still selected, use the Copy action. You can press Ctrl+C on Windows, Command+C on Mac, right-click and pick "Copy," or click "Copy" (two pages icon) in the ribbon on the Home tab.
