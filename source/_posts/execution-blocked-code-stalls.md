## 3\. Update your graphics drivers

 our graphics driver is an essential piece of software that lets your system communicate with the graphics card. If it is outdated, it would cause noticeable performance problems. While driver updates include the latest patches for security flaws, fix problems, and sometimes even provide you with completely new features, all for free. Therefore, in order to enjoy your game to the fullest, you should make sure your graphics card is up-to-date.

 To update your graphics driver, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or head to the manufacturer’s driver download page ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) / [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) to download and install the exact driver for your system. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with missing or outdated drivers.

[Xbox One](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### PlayStation: download files from MyCAREER

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 After you’ve done all of these, you need to load back to your game. If it says**high school** when you load it, then you wouldn’t have the green glitch.

### Steam

 If you play NBA 2K21 on Steam and got the green glitch, you’re supposed to**disable the Steam overlay** and**verify your game files** .

#### Disable the Steam overlay

 1) Click on the**LIBRARY** tab, right-click on your game**NBA 2K21,** and select Properties.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/disable-the-steam-overlay-6.png)

 2) Under the**GENERAL** section, uncheck**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .

![disable steam overlay NBA 2K21 Green Glitch](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/disable-the-steam-overlay-3.png)

 After applying the change, exit Steam and play your game again to see if the issue is fixed. If not, try verifying your game files.

#### Verify your game files

 There is a possibility that your game data becomes corrupted and it might lead to the green glitch. So to fix it, you need to verify your game files.

To do this, simply follow the instructions below:

 1) Click on the**LIBRARY** tab, right-click on your game**NBA 2K21,** and select**Properties** .

![verify game files NBA 2K21 Green Glitch](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/disable-the-steam-overlay-5.png)

 2) When the window pops up, click**LOCAL FILES** \>**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES** . Till then, the verification process will be starting.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) When the process is completed, restart Steam and launch your game again.

### Xbox One: make sure the language is set to English

 If you don’t set the language to English, then it’s one of the reasons you got the green glitch.

 1) Go to**FEATURES** in 2K.

![set the language into English NBA 2K21 Green Glitch](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/set-the-language-into-English-1.png)

 2) Click**SETTINGS** and scroll down to**Menu Language** and make sure the language is set to**English** .
