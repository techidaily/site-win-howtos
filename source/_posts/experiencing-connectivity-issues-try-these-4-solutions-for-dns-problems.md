### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

 Ideally Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set it as the default playback device every time it’s plugged into. But that’s not always the case and sometimes we’ll have to set default devices manually and set its sound levels.

To do so:

1. Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3c30ff817bf.jpg)
2. Click the **Recording** tab, then click on **your microphone device** and click **Set Default** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3c319e23198.jpg)  
 If **your microphone device doesn’t show up in the device list** , then right-click on **the empty space**  and tick **Show Disabled Devices** . Then right-click on the microphone device once it appears and click **Enable** before you do step **2)** .

### Fix 4: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 If none of the fixes works for you, it’s time to check for potential hardware issues.

You can follow the steps below to narrow down and troubleshoot:

1. Connect your microphone device to **another port**  on your laptop. If the mic works in the other port, it suggests this issue is probably caused by a faulty port, if your mic still doesn’t work, move on to**2)** , below.
2. Connect your microphone device to **another computer** . If your mic works in another PC, you should contact the vendor of your laptop for advice; if your mic still doesn’t work in another PC,  you should contact the vendor of your microphone device for support.
