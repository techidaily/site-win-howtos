### Method 4: Update your USB device and motherboard chipset drivers

 If your**USB device** and**motherboard chipset drivers** are outdated or corrupted, you might also keep getting the error. We highly recommend you update your USB device driver (if your USB device has the driver) and motherboard chipset driver to make your USB device work well.

 There are**two ways** you can get the right driver for your USB device and motherboard chipset: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your USB device and motherboard chipset drivers manually by going to the**manufacturer’s website** for both your USB device and motherboard and searching for the most recent correct drivers for them. Be sure to choose the only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows system.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your USB device and motherboard chipset drivers manually, you can, instead,**do it automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your devices, and your variant of Windows system, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b99d645eaf39.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support** and a**30-day money back** guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  
 Note: You can do it**for free** if you like, but it’s partly manual.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b99dd433fd12.jpg)

Restart your computer to see if the error disappears.
