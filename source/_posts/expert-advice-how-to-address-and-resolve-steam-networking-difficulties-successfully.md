 5) If any of them is disabled, enable it and restart your computer.

### Fix 2: Update graphics card driver

 The missing or outdated graphics card driver can cause the**Failed to initialize unity graphics** error, so you should update your graphics card driver to the latest version to fix the issue.

 There are two ways to update the video driver in your computer: manually and automatically.

 You can manually search the latest version for your graphics card driver from the manufacturer, then download and install the driver in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

 If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you will get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ).

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics device to automatically download the correct version of the driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version), then install the driver in your computer.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **_Update All_** ).

### Fix 3: Roll back graphics card driver

 You can also try to roll back your graphics card driver to resolve the error.

 You can manually roll back your graphics card driver in Device Manager. It’s recommended you backup the important data in your computer before processing driver roll back.
