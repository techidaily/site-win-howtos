### Method 1: Remove browser extensions

1) Double click the Google Chrome shortcut.

2) Type “chrome://extensions” in the Chrome address bar and press**Enter** .

 But sometimes, it could lead to the unresponsive error. Turn off this option to see if the error is fixed.

1) Double click the Google Chrome shortcut.

2) Hit the three dots button in the upper right corner, then click**Settings** .

### Method 5: Add`“--process-per-site”` parameter

 Chrome creates a completely separate operating system process for each tag or extra extension you use. If you have multiple tabs open and various third-party extensions installed, you may find many processes running at the same time.  
 Multiple Chrome processes running in the background could be the reason for the unresponsive error. Therefore, preventing Chrome from opening too many processes could solve this problem.

 1) Right-click on your Google Chrome shortcut and click**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 2) Under the**Shortcut** tab, add`“--process-per-site”` in the Target box and then click**Apply** .  
 Next, a window will appear. Click**Continue** , then click**OK** .  
**Note** : There’s a space before`“--process-per-site”` .

 3) Restart Chrome and open a URL in the third-party app to check whether the error will appear or not.

**Note** : If this method works for you, you should start Chrome with this shortcut every time.

### Method 6: Rename the Google Chrome profile

 Corruption of Chrome’s system default files could also cause this error. You can create a new Chrome profile to solve it by simply renaming the Default folder.  

1) Make sure your Google Chrome is closed completely.

2) Press the**Windows logo key** +**R** together on your keyboard to open the Run box.

3) Type “%LOCALAPPDATA%” and press**Enter** .
