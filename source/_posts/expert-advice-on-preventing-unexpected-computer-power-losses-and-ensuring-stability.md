![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/solved-1200x217.png)

 When you try to refresh your IP address or release it, you may bump into**Unable to Contact DHCP Server** . The error means that the your network interface controller cannot communicate with the DHCP server and thus the action has failed.

 There are usually a combination of reasons for this issue, but don’t worry. In this article, we’re providing you with 5 fixes, so that you can work your way down until you sort out the problem.

## Fix 1 – Is it a driver issue?

 The network adapter driver, which works as an interpreter between your network adapter and your PC, is essential to the proper functioning of the network adapter. Depending on different situations, you may encounter the **Unable to Contact DHCP Server** error when your network driver is outdated or new and problematic (hence requiring a rollback). There are ways you can do it manually, but if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**
