### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

 Ideally Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set it as the default playback device every time it’s plugged into. But that’s not always the case and sometimes we’ll have to set default devices manually and set its sound levels.

To do so:

1. Right-click on  **the sound icon**  on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click  **Sounds**  .

2. Click the **Recording**   tab, then click on **Microphone SteelSeries Arctis 5 chat**   and click **Set Default** .

 If**Microphone SteelSeries Arctis 5 chat** doesn’t show up in the device list, then right-click on **the empty space** and tick **Show Disabled Devices** . Then right-click on **the microphone device**  once it appears and click **Enable** before you do step **2)** .
3. Click on **Microphone SteelSeries Arctis 5 chat**   and click **Properties** .
