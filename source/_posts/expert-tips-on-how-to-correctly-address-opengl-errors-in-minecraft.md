## Fix 5: Remove Mods

 Various mods are available for Minecraft and it’s normal to use mods when playing Minecraft. However, mods sometimes change your game’s behavior and may cause unknown problems. So if you use mods while playing Minecraft, remove all mods you’ve installed.

 If your game works perfectly, the issue was certainly caused by mods. You can check mods one by one to see which one causes the problem.  
 If your issue still persists, don’t worry. There is something else to try

## Fix 6: Update your video card driver

 The “Minecraft won’t launch” problem is probably being caused by driver issues. If you’re using the wrong video card driver or the driver is out of date, you may meet this problem. In addition to solving this problem, updating drivers can also improve your computer performance.  
 There are two ways to update your drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 To get the latest driver, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update video card drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

But with the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):
