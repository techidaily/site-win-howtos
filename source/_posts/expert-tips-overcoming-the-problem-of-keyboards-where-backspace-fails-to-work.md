## Fix 2: Update the Corsair keyboard driver

 This lighting problem may occur if you are using**the wrong keyboard driver or it’s out of date** . So you should check if there’s any updated version of your Corsair keyboard driver and upgrade to it to see if the backlight problem can be fixed.

 You can update your drivers manually by going to[**the Corsair website**](https://r.brandreward.com/?key=3882aba4cadd4473e0195097fdf20855&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.corsair.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fdownloads&mktsrc=drivereasyen%5F167630) , downloading the driver installer for your keyboard and installing it step by step.
