 This error could be also cause by an outdated, corrupted or missing graphics card driver. You can solve it through updating your graphics card driver. What’s more,**for the best gaming performance** , you should keep your device driver, especially the graphics card driver up-to-date.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your graphics card: manually or automatically.

Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows operating system.
