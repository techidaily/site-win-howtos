**Option 1 – Manually** : You can first uninstall your device drivers in Device Manager, and go to the official website to download the correct drivers matched with your Windows OS. That may require time and computer skills.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** : If you don’t have the time or skills to update the drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 With Driver Easy, you don’t need to figure out the Operating System, and you don’t need to worry about making mistakes while processing. That will tremendously save you time and patience.
