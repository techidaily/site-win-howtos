### Fix 3\. Update your printer driver

 The missing or outdated printer driver can cause the Print driver host for 32bit applications has stopped working error, so you should make sure that your printer driver is up to date.

 There are two ways to update drivers: **manually**   and **automatically** .

**Manually**   – You can manually update the printer driver: go to the website of your printer manufacturer, find the latest and correct driver and **install**   it in your computer. This requires the time and computer skills.

**Automatically**   – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do that automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE**   or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you’ll have a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
