 (If granting Steam with administrative rights didn’t solve the issue, proceed to the next[fix2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . )

 3) Exit Steam and make sure it’s not running in the background. You can press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box. Type in**taskmgr** and press**Enter** . Navigate to all the Steam services. Right-click on each and select**End task** .
