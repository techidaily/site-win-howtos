## Try these fixes

 Here are 4 solutions you can try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

1. **[Update your keyboard driver](#solution1)**
2. **[Check if the print screen key is enabled](#solution2)**
3. **[Stop all the running programs](#solution3)**
4. **[Update your operating system](#solution4)**
5. **[Bonus Tip](#additional)**

### Fix 1: Update your keyboard driver

 This problem is probably caused by an old or incorrect keyboard driver. You can update your printer driver manually or, if you’re not confident playing around with drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the Update button next to a flagged keyboard driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **Pro** version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

### Fix 2: Check if the print screen key is enabled

```` ```` Try to press**F Mode** key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2-3.png) or**F Lock** key![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1-2.png) (when there are such keys on your keyboard, if not, please skip this fix), then check if the Print Screen works. That’s because such keys may prevent you from using print screen key.
