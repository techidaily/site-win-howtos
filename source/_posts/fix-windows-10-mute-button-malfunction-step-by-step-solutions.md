![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/img_5bbdbe55a63de.jpg)

 When you plug your AOC USB monitor, if your computer goes totally black screen, you definitely encounter the AOC USB monitor not working issue. This issue may happen after you upgrad your computer to Windows 10\. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. And this should be easy to fix.  
 Read on to find how…

1. **[Run troubleshooter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Reinstall the AOC USB Monitor driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Method 1: Run troubleshooter

 Windows has built-in troubleshoot to fix the common error in the operating system. This issue may due to hardware conflicts. To solve the problem, you can run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. Here’s how:

1. Type “troubleshoot” in the search bar and press**Enter** .

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.
5. Relaunch your computer and check the issue is resolved or not.

 If you fail to find Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter in Control Panel, that’s probably because your computer version is after **Windows 10 build 1809** . The version has removed the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter. Don’t worry, you can still run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter in this way:

1. Right-click on the**Start** button, then click**Windows PowerShell (Admin)** .
