## Method 1: Allow the torrent client in Windows Firewall or Antivirus Software

 Why is torrent not downloading? One of the reasons is that the torrent client could be blocked by Windows Firewall or Antivirus Software. If that’s the case, you can configure the settings to allow the torrent client in Windows Firewall or antivirus software.

**Steps to** **allow the torrent client in Windows Firewall** are as follows:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type ‘control panel’ in the box and click**OK** to open Control Panel.

 5) Click**Change settings** and check the boxes next to the torrent client related items.

 For example, if you’re using uTorrent, check the boxes next to the uTorrent related items.

 6) Click**OK** to apply the changes.

 7) Check to see if you can download the torrent file.

**Instructions to** **allow the torrent client in antivirus software** are as follows:

 If you’ve installed an antivirus software on your computer, the antivirus software might probably take over control Windows Firewall. You just need to configure the settings in the antivirus software to allow the torrent client.

 The steps to allow torrent clients in antivirus software vary depending on different antivirus software. If you’re not sure how to configure it, you can google with the related keywords. For example, if you’re using antivirus software ‘Avast’, you can google with the keywords like ‘unblock program Avast’. The way to unblock a program in the antivirus software is the same way to unblock the torrent client in the antivirus software.

 If you can’t find the steps on your own, you can contact the vendor for further assistance. There are chances that your antivirus software doesn’t allow torrenting.

## Method 2: Ensure the network allows torrenting

 Torrent not downloading can be caused by the network restriction. If you’re on a public network, such as school network, company network, coffee shop network, etc., it could be that the network you’re using is blocking torrent files. Or it could be your ISP blocking torrenting traffic to prevent network congestion.

 If that’s the case for you, you can use a VPN, such as **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to bypass the network restriction. A VPN can mask your IP address and make it look like you’re accessing the network in other countries. If you can’t download torrent files due to geo-restriction, a VPN can resolve the problem.

 If you’re not sure what VPN you can use, here’s our recommendations:

* **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Surfshark](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fr.brandreward.com%2F%3Fkey%3D3882aba4cadd4473e0195097fdf20855%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fsurfshark.com%26id%3Ddrivereasyen100084)**
* **[CyberGhost VPN.](https://r.brandreward.com/?key=3882aba4cadd4473e0195097fdf20855&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcyberghostvpn.com&id=drivereasyen100084)**

 We’ll use **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this tutorial but you can use other VPN as well. Follow the steps below to see how to bypass the network geo-restriction in three steps:

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) NordVPN to your device.

2) Launch NordVPN.

3) Connect to a server in a specific location, for example, United States.

## Method 3: Remove trackers that have connection issues

 If the trackers have connection issues, torrent not downloading issue can happen. To resolve the problem, you can try to remove the trackers.

 The detailed steps to remove trackers may vary depending on different torrent clients. We’ll take removing trackers from uTorrent as an example. If you’re using other torrent clients, you can refer to the steps. But if it doesn’t help, we recommend you contact the support of your torrent client for further assistance.

Here is how to remove trackers from uTorrent:

1) Select the torrent that cannot be downloaded.

2) Under the**Trackers** tab, right-click on the tracker that has the connection issue (You may see the tracker shows Timeout status), then select**Remove Tracker** .

## Method 4: Try downloading torrent files from another torrent website

 Different torrent website provides different types of torrent files. You need to download the torrent file from right torrent websites. See[The Best 10 Torrent Sites in 2019](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which recommends the best torrent websites.

## Method 6: Use a compatible VPN

 VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that lets you disguise your IP address, encrypts your data, and makes your online activity completely anonymous – so the network you’re connected to can’t tell what site you’re trying to visit therefore can’t interfere with your browsing.

 While a solid VPN allows you to bypass network throttling and censorship blocks, a non-compatible one can cause torrent not downloading. To resolve the problem, you can try using another VPN.
