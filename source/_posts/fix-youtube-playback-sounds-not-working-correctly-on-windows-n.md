## Fix 1\. Reinstall or update USB drivers

 Most Windows USB problems are driver-related. As the translator for your system and the device, the driver takes a great role in making sure your PC is working great. If the USB driver gets corrupted or outdated, the USB port may not work as expected.

 To fix the problem, you might need to manually[reinstall the USB driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) yourself in Device Manager. However, this method takes time and computer skills. So if you’re not very confident in playing with device drivers yourself, you can, instead, use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to let it do all the work for you.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

## Fix 2\. Disable USB Selective Suspend

## Fix 4\. Make sure the charger is working

 Another likely reason for USB-C not working on Windows 10 could be **insufficient PC charging** . To avoid this, you should use the charger and cable included with your PC.

 If this didn’t work, you can remove your laptop battery and press the power button for 30 seconds or longer.

 This will make sure the capacitors discharge completely. Leave your laptop for 3\~5 minutes (although we recommend turning off your laptop without a battery over the night), and check to see if the USB is working again.

## Fix 5\. Install Windows Updates

 Although less likely, there is a chance that updating your system could solve your USB port problems. Press the Windows + R to open the Search box and enter check, and then select**Check for updates** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/check-for-updates-1.jpg)

 Check for updates and it will download and install available updates for you.
