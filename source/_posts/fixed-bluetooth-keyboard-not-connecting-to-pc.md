## Fix 1: Check your Bluetooth keyboard

 **Your Bluetooth keyboard can stop working if the batteries are worn out or not installed properly.** To test the batteries, you can simply replace them with brand new ones or recharge the batteries by connecting the charging cable to a power source.

 If your keyboard has an**On/Off** switch, make sure it’s set to**On** . Try turning off your keyboard and then turning it on to see if that fixes your problem.

 **Make sure your Bluetooth keyboard is discoverable and in range of the PC you need to connect to.** Remove other USB devices as these might interfere with Bluetooth connections.

## Fix 2: Check your PC

 The airplane mode on your computer can automatically turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. So you should make sure airplane mode is turned off and Bluetooth is turned on. Here’s how:

### in Windows 10

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. In Windows Settings, click**Network & Internet** .
