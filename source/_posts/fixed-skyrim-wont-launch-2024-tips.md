## How to Fix Low FPS When Gaming - 2024 Tips

 Nothing can be more distracting than having a low frame rate when you’re immersing yourself in a game, and the sluggish and rubber-banding movements are not just eyesores, they can literally give you a headache. It’s time to stop such a bad experience now. If you’re also having low FPS during games, here are some fixes that have helped many others to improve their FPS. So if you’re bothered by low FPS when gaming, this post has the right fixes for you.

## Try these fixes for low FPS when gaming

 You don’t have to try all 10 methods listed here: simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick to improve the FPS for you.

1. **[For starters, if you’re experiencing a sudden FPS drop…](#m1)**
2. **[Review your game’s system requirements](#m2)**
3. **[Update the game](#m3)**
4. **[Close bandwidth-intensive services and applications](#m4)**
5. **[Repair or verify the game files](#m5)**
6. **[Update graphics card driver](#m6)**
7. **[Change the Power Mode](#m7)**
8. **[Defragment your hard drive (HDD only)](#m8)**
9. **[Search for player tweaks and mods](#m9)**
10. **[Upgrade hardware](#m10)**

---

## 1\. For starters, if you’re experiencing a sudden FPS drop…

 If the FPS drop you’re experiencing happens all of a sudden, and the problem wasn’t seen before at all, then the problem could be with the network connection situation. In this case, you need to try the following first to make sure that your network connection is still all good and with no interrupts:

* **Check the game status page** . You can usually find the status page by searching “game name + status” on Google. If the game servers are interrupted, then the sudden FPS drop should be a universal problem, so all you can do is wait for the game developers to get their servers fixed.
* **Use a wired network connection** (with an Ethernet cable) instead of Wi-Fi. If this is not an option, move your computer closer to the router.
* **Play on your local server** . If that’s not an option, choose one that is closest to you.
* **Update your router firmware** if you haven’t already.
* **Don’t use any VPN, proxy or antivirus programs or services** , as they might also interrupt your network, and cause the sudden FPS dropping issue.

 If the FPS never looks good on your computer during games, please move on to check other fixes.

---

## 2\. Review your game’s system requirements

 If the frame rate hasn’t been good for you when gaming, one of the first things you should do is to make sure that your computer specs are well above the minimum system requirements for the games. If your machine is below or just at the requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware for some games to run smoothly, especially newer games that were released in recent years, as they usually require more advanced computer hardware devices.

 To find out the minimum system requirements for your games, simply search “game name + system requirements” on Google, and you should see. For instance, if my Starfield has a low FPS issue, then I’ll need to search “Starfield system requirements”, and this page will have the information that I need:[https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/60442/~/system-requirements—pc—starfield](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/60442/~/system-requirements---pc---starfield)

 If you’re not sure how to check your computer specs, you can refer to this post here for more detailed information:[**How to Check Your PC’s Specifications**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/how-to-check-pc-specs)

 When you’re sure that your machine meets (or better, way above) the system requirements to run the games, but you’re still experiencing low FPS problems, please move on to the other fixes below.

---

## 3\. Update the game

 Game developers often release patches or fixes that help to improve their gaming performance, which include improving FPS. So if you haven’t set your games to update automatically, it’s time for you to update the game manually now.

 If there’s no newer version of the game available, and the FPS remains low, please move on to the other fixes below.

---

## 4\. Close bandwidth-intensive services and applications

 If there are bandwidth-intensive services and applications, like background downloads, music streaming, or video streaming, running when you’re gaming, please disable them, as their occupation of the network connection resource is likely the culprit to your low FPS in games.

To do so:

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-48.png)
2. Select each resource-hogging application and click**End Task** to close them one by one.

## 6\. Update graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to the low FPS problem in game, so if the above methods don’t help to improve the FPS situation, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

## 7\. Change the Power Mode

 The default power plan by Windows strikes a balance between power consumption and PC performance, which is a good choice most of the time, especially when you’re not using resource-hungry applications a lot. But games usually need more resources than other regular software programs, so it’s not a bad idea to switch to the**High performance** plan to improve your game performance. This is even more true when you’re having a low FPS.

To change the power mode:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time, then type **powercfg.cpl** and press **Enter** .

## 8\. Defragment your hard drive (HDD only)

 It’s usually suggested that you install the games (especially newly released ones in recent years) on your SSD rather than HDD. This is because games usually consume more hardware resources than the other programs, and installing the game on the SSD is one of the basics to make sure that your games run smoothly, given the more advanced hardware support.

 If you don’t have an SSD, and you have a low FPS, it’s probably time for you to defragment your HDD, especially when you haven’t done it in a rather long time. To do so:

 Please don’t defragment your SSD, as it could shorten the life expectancy of your hard drive.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**defrag** . Then select**Defragmenet and Optimize Drives** from the list.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-109.png)
2. Select the hard drive that you have installed the game on, and select**Optimize** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-110.png)
3. Then run your game again to see if the frame rate remains low. If so, please move on.

---

## 9\. Search for player tweaks and mods

 If you’ve already tried the above but still have rather low FPS in the game, you can consider some player tweaks and mods on trusted forums and websites, as such workarounds could be the best you can get before the game developers release an updated version. From what we know,[**Nexus**](https://www.nexusmods.com/) is still a rather good go-to website if you’re interested in getting mods.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 10\. Upgrade hardware

 If none of the above helps to fix the low FPS problem when gaming for you, maybe it’s time for you to consider investing in more powerful hardware devices, like a faster CPU, more RAM, a newer and more advanced graphics card, etc.

 If you’re not sure what hardware devices to look for when upgrading your computer, the[**Pro version of Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) comes with full technical support. If you need any assistance, you can contact Driver Easy’s support team at <[support@drivereasy.com](mailto:) \> for further help.
