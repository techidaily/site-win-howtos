---

## **Method 1: Check if your device is discoverable**

 If your AirDrop is not working in your device, you may need to check if you have make your device discoverable. AirDrop must be manually enabled in Control Center on iOS devices and in the Mac’s Finder for it to work. Check the following steps:

**Note** : All the screenshots below are shown on iOS 10, but the fixes apply to other iOS versions as well.

**On iOS devices** :

 1)**Swipe up** from the bottom of your device screen.

 2) Tap**AirDrop** button to turn it on.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **Step 2: Make sure all the devices are within detected range**

 As mentioned, AirDrop works based on WiFi and Bluetooth, so your devices must be within the WiFi and Bluetooth range to be able to detected. You can’t AirDrop to users who are out of the defined range.

 It’s recommended to be as**closer** as possible when using AirDrop, and do not beyond**20 feet** (**6 meters** ), which may make your device undiscoverable.

### **Step 3: Turn off your AirPlane mode**

 The Airplane mode cuts off your iPhone’s connection to all wireless networks, both cellular and Wi-Fi, so your AirDrop won’t be working if your AirPlane mode is on.

 1)**Swipe** **up** from the bottom of your device screen.

 2) Tap the**Airplane** button to turn it off. The button is grey if it’s turned off.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Try your AirDrop again to see if it works.

### **Step 4: Make sure your device screen is on when using AirDrop**

 If the iOS device screen is off when AirDrop items, you would fail to send/receive the items. So**make sure your iOS device screen is on** when using AirDrop.

 As for Mac, you can use AirDrop when your Mac screen is off, but make sure it’s**not in sleep mode** . Sleep mode will stop AirDrop from working properly, too.

### **Step 5: Do not to transfer files of different types**

 For now, you can transfer many types of files by AirDrop, but you can’t transfer different types of files at one time with AirDrop. Please make sure you**transfer the same type of file once a time** .

---

**Note** : Both the devices that using AirDrop need to be signed in the iCloud account.

 1) Go to**Settings** , and tap**your name** to go to**iCloud** .

## **Method 4: Check Personal Hotspot**

 This is a step that people may forget to check: Personal Hotsopt. It lets you share the cellular data connection of your iPhone or iPad (Wi-Fi + Cellular) when you don’t have access to a Wi-Fi network.

 2) Tap the button next to**Personal Hotspot** to turn it off.
