## Fix 1: Change your download region

 In most cases, the Steam download problem might be related to the download server: the server is either faced with a technical issue or is congested with people downloading or updating. You can try to change your download region to fix this issue, by following these steps:

1. On your Steam client, click**Steam** , then click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/steam-settings.jpg)
2. Click **Downloads** , then click the drop-down menu of **Download Region** to choose a different region.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/steam-download-region-1.jpg)
3. Click **OK** to save the setting.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Here the key is to find a location where there isn’t a lot of traffic. So you might have to keep switching download servers until you find one that works. But if it is not helping at all, simply move on to the next fix.

## Fix 2: Clear download cache

 Sometimes corrupted cache data can cause download problems. So you can try to clear the download cache to get rid of any obsolete files impeding download progress:

1. Open the **Steam**  menu and select **Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/steam-settings.jpg)
2. Click**Downloads** . Then select **CLEAR DOWNLOAD CACHE** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/steam-clear-download-cache.jpg)
3. Click**OK** in the pop-up box.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/steam-clear-download-cache-ok.jpg)

 You can resume the download to check again. If the issue disappears, congrats! If not, just move on to the next fix.

## Fix 3: Repair library folder

 The Steam library folder stores the files Steam needs in order to run your games. You may experience issues if you have outdated files or subfolders. To fix this problem, you can try to repair the library folder. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open the **Steam**  menu and select **Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/steam-settings.jpg)
2. Click**Downloads** . Then, select **STEAM LIBRARY FOLDERS** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/steam-library-folder.jpg)
3. Click the**3 dots** on the right side, and select**Repair Folder** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/3-dots-repair-folder.jpg)
4. After it’s done, click**Close** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/repair-folder-done.jpg)

 Then try to download your game to test for the issue. If it remains, move on to the second method.

## Fix 4: Reset Windows proxy settings

 If none of the fixes above works for you, you can try to disable Windows proxy settings. Here’s how to do it:

1. Click the **Start** button and type**proxy** in the Windows search bar. Then select**Proxy settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/proxy2.jpg)
2. Turn off the **Automatically detect settings** button.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/proxy-turn-off.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After turning it off, go to check if your Steam works properly. If it doesn’t do the trick, simply move on to the next fix.

## Fix 5: Update your network driver

 An outdated or corrupted network adapter driver may affect your network connection and your download speed. So another way to fix your download issue is to update your network adapter driver.

 To update drivers manually, you can visit the manufacturer’s websites and select, download and install the drivers you want.

 But if you don’t have the time or patience for it, or you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can simply do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It can automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. Here is how to use it:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/de-scan.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro** **version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/scan-result.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If you don’t want to pay for it, you can just download the drivers with the **[free version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You will have to download one at a time, and install them manually.

 After updating your drivers, restart your computer and check if the problem is solved. If nothing changes, keep reading.

## Fix 6: Flush DNS cache

 An obsolete DNS resolver cache in your computer could also prevent your Steam from connecting to download servers, and deleting it may help. Here’s how to do it:

1. Click the **Start** button, and type **cmd** in the Windows search bar. Then right-click**Command Prompt** and select **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cmd-command-prompt-modified-1.jpg)
2. When a pop-up box comes up, type**ipconfig /flushdns** . Then hit**enter** key. You should see a message which confirms that the DNS Resolver Cache has been flushed successfully.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cmd-type.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Check if the issue persists. If not, check out the fix below.

## Fix 7: Verify the integrity of game files

 Sometimes, bad hardware, software crashes and power surges can cause corruption in the local files of the game, and consequently cause Steam downloads to stick at 0 bytes. Steam can verify the correctness over installed game files and fix them if necessary. Follow the instructions given below:

1. Navigate to the **Library** section of your Steam client,**right-click on the game** you are experiencing the issue with.
2. Select **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/game-property.jpg)
3. Click**LOCAL FILES** and select the **Verify integrity of game files** option.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/local-files-verify-integrity.jpg)  
 But please note that this fix only works when the game has been downloaded a little bit before it gets stuck at 0 bytes, otherwise LOCAL FILES would not exist yet.

If the problem persists, there is one more fix you can try.

## Fix 8: Temporarily disable your antivirus software

 Your firewall or antivirus software can sometimes cause interference to the network connection of your Steam client.

 To see if that happens, temporarily disable your antivirus program for the duration of the Steam download and see if the issue persists. (You can consult your antivirus program documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If this resolves your problem, you can add Steam to the whitelist of your firewall by visiting its configuration pane. You can also contact the vendor of your firewall and ask for help.

 When your antivirus service is disabled, be careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download.

 Hopefully one of the fixes above help you fix your issue. If you have any questions or better suggestions, please feel free to leave a comment below.
