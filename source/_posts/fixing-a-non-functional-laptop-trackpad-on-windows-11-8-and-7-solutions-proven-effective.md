### Fix 1: Update your sound driver

 Your volume control not working issue is most likely caused by the outdated/corrupted sound driver, which might very well develop further issues like sound crackling/stuttering or no sound at all if unattended. So we should always make sure to**have the latest sound driver installed on our system** for the good health of our PC.

 There’re two ways you can update your device drivers — manually or automatically. But the manual driver updating process can be time-consuming and risky, so we won’t be covering it here.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either[**the FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[**the Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **Download**  and install Driver Easy.

2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b46ffcde1143.jpg)
3. You can upgrade to **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of **ALL**  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bb5cfcaf3cc0.jpg)  
 You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual
4. **Restart** your computer and see if you can adjust the volume on your PC just fine.

### Fix 2: Restart the Windows Audio service and **Windows Audio Endpoint Builder**

 Another reason for this volume control not responding problem is the glitches with the Windows Audio and Windows Audio Endpoint Builder services. If that’s the case, we can re-enable them to see if it works.

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**  and  **R**  at the same time. Then type **services.msc**   into the box and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bb5cdb63e3b0.png)
2. Locate and double-click on**Windows Audio** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bb5ce1733bbb.jpg)
3. Click**Stop** \>**Start** . Then click**Apply** \>**OK** .

### Fix 3: Run SFC

 Another fix you can try is to run the SFC(a built-in Windows file check & repair tool) scan since the missing/corrupted system files can be the culprit for the volume control not working problem.

To run SFC:

1. On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**  and type **cmd** . Then right click on **Command Prompt**   and click **Run as administrator** .

 Click **Yes**   when prompted to confirm.
2. In the command prompt window, type **sfc /scannow**   and press **Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b28aee247664.jpg)  
 It’ll take some time for the SFC to replace the corrupted system files with new ones if it detects any, so please be patient.
3. **Restart** your computer and check if the volume control not working problem is solved. If not, continue with **Fix 4** .

### Fix 4: Run the Playing Audio troubleshooter

 If all else fails, then you might have to run the built-in audio troubleshooter in our Windows to solve the problem.

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press   **the Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**  and type **troubleshoot** , then click **Troubleshoot** .
