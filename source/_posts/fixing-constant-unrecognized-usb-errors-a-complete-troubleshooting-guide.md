## Solution 1: Boot your PC without Peripherals

 External peripherals can sometimes conflict with your system and trigger errors of all sorts. So before we dive into anything deeper, let’s start with the easiest solution: restarting your PC without peripherals.

**1)**  Press and hold the **power button**  until your computer turns off.

**2)**  Disconnect all **peripherals**  (your printer, scanner, webcam, mouse, etc.).

**3)**  Try turning on your computer again.

 If your computer boots correctly, that means that one of the peripherals you removed is causing your problem. You should **reinstall each device** back into your computer and test them each time. Then, you’ll find the specific device that causes your problem. Replace the device once you’ve identified it. Or, consult the manufacturer of the device for assistance.

If your computer still can’t boot correctly, try the fix below.

## Solution 2: Check the RAM

 Your computer might be unresponsive during the startup process when your RAMs are not well installed, or in some cases, one or more of your RAM modules or RAM slots is faulty.

 1) Press and hold the**power button** until your computer turns off.

 2) Open your computer case.

 This process will vary depending on different types of computers. If you don’t know how to do it, consult your computer’s documentation or seek professional help.

3) On your motherboard, remove your RAMs from the memory slots.

RAM looks like this:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/computer-memory-857098_640-1024x381.jpg)

 4) Put your RAMs back into the slot one by one while trying to boot each time.

 If your computer starts without one or more of the RAMs, then it could be an issue with your RAM modules. Or in some cases, it is possible that your RAM module is fine, but one or more memory slots on your motherboard are defective. You may want to try removing the modules and placing them in different slots to find if one of the slots is faulty.

 If your computer still can’t boot properly, don’t worry. Check the fix below.

## Solution 3: Reset BIOS Settings

 When you’re booting up your computer, BIOS instructs it on how to boot up the operating system. And improper BIOS settings can cause computer boot issues.

 You can reset your BIOS settings back to it’s original to see if that’s the issue for you. Here is how to do it:

1) Press and hold the power button until your computer turns off.

2) Disconnect the AC power cord from the power supply, and then open your computer case.

3) On your motherboard, remove your CMOS battery with your fingernail or a non-conductive screwdriver.

The CMOS battery looks like this

4) Wait for 5 minutes, and then reinstall your CMOS battery.

5) Connect the AC power cord to the power supply, and then turn on your computer to see if your problem persists.
