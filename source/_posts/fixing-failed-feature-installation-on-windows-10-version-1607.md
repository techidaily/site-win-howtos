### Fix 2: Reset Windows Update components

 This issue may occur if there’s something wrong with Windows Update components. If Windows Update components corrupted, Windows Update may not work properly. In this case, try resetting Windows Update components. Here is how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog. Type **cmd** and press **Ctrl** , **Shift** and **Enter** at the same time to **run Command Prompt as administrator** . You’ll be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to open Command Prompt.

 2) In Command Prompt, type the command lines below and press **Enter** on your keyboard **after typing each** :

net stop bits  
  
net stop wuauserv  
  
net stop appidsvc  
  
net stop cryptsvc

 The Windows Update related system services will be stopped after executing the command lines above.

 3) In Command Prompt, type the following command lines and press **Enter** after typing each:

ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old  
  
ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.old

 You will**rename** the**SoftwareDistribution** and**catroot2** folder as**SoftwareDistribution.old** and**catroot2.old** after you run these two command lines. These two folders are used by Windows Update to save temporary update files.  

 By renaming these two folders, **Windows will think these two folders are missing, and Windows will create new ones to store Windows update files.** By doing that, you can avoid many Windows Update issues caused by the old corrupted temporary files in these two folders.

 4) In Command Prompt, type the following command lines and press **Enter** after each:

net start bits  
  
net start wuauserv  
  
net start appidsvc  
  
net start cryptsvc

 After you executing the command lines above, you start the Windows Update related system services.
