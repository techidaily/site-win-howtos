## 1\. Run Steam as administrator

 These error messages may indicate that it’s a permission issue. If the Steam client didn’t have the necessary permissions to download the updates, the issue will occur and you will not be able to continue the download process. To fix it, you can forcibly open Steam with administrative privileges.

 1) Right-click on the shortcut and select**Run as Administrator** .  
  
![Run Steam as administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Run-Steam-as-administrator.png)
