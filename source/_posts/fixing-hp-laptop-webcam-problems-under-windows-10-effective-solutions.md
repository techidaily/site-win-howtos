 If you are seeing an**access denied** file or folder error on your Windows system, you are not alone. Many Windows users have got it. This usually occurs when they are accessing or making changes to a file or folder. Sometimes the error appears when upgrading from a previous version of Windows.

## Method 1: Take the ownership of the file or folder

**5)**  If this method works for you, you won’t get the access denied error when you try to open or modify the file or folder.  
  
## Method 3: Recover your data

 It is also possible that you get the access denied error because the file or folder you are accessing is corrupted. You can’t open it or make any changes. Honestly, in most cases, the corrupted files and folders cannot be repaired. You can only either delete it or recover it from a backup copy. But still you can utilize some data recovery tools or services to recover data from a corrupted folder. So if the data in the problem folder is important for you, you can try using find some programs or services to perform data recovery in order to save them.
