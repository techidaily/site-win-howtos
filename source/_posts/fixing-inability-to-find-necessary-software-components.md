![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/no-detect.jpg)

 You must be vexing when you bought a Corsair Gaming keyboard but were welcomed with a “**NO DEVICE DETECTED. PLEASE CONNECT A DEVICE** “. You are unable to customize the profiles and LEDs on the keyboard due to the device tabs both being greyed out and unclickable which was a big selling point. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. And here’s methods that can help you fix this issue.

## Try these fixes

 There are common fixes and more complicated ones. You don’t need to try them all but it’s recommended to try the common fixes first. If these can’t help, try other fixes one by one to find the one that works for you.

### Common fixes

* Use another USB port.
* Reinstalling Corsair Utility Engine does not help, try to quit the software and rerun it.
* Disconnected the keyboard and held the**ESC** key while plugging back in.
* Press the**Windows key + F1** on the keyboard at the same time to do a hard reboot.
* Open**Task Manager** by pressing**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** together. Choose**CorsairHID.exe** and click**End task** , then restart Corsair Utility Engine.
* In the back of the keyboard, there’s the BIOS button. You can switch it to a different number for a try. You may see it suddenly detects the keyboard.

### Method 3: Update your drivers

 If you uninstall other applications before this issue happened, it’s possible you may uninstall USB or related drivers accidentally. The outdated or missing drivers can cause problems to your computer and it’s important to keep your drivers up-to-date for a better user experience.

 There’re two ways to update your drivers: manually and automatically.

 You can download products drivers from its manufacturer official website. You have to search your model name to find the correct model and choose your specific flavor of Windows system (Window 10 64-bits or etc.) Then download the driver manually.
