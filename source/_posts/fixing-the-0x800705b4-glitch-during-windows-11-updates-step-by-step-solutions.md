## **Method 4:** Repair system files

 The 0x800705b4 Error may be related to system files. When the system files were broken or corrupted, it may cause a Blue screen issue.

There are 2 ways to solve it. Here’s how:

* Option 2 – Manually

 If the result indicates there are broken files but SFC can’t fix them, you can turn to [Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) Tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) for deeper examination and repair.

## Method 6: Update the Drivers

 The steps above may resolve the problem, but if they don’t, it’s time to update the drivers. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the drivers manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
