## Fix 2: Change advanced power settings

 Insufficient power supply is a very common reason why your Windows 10 computer restarts randomly, especially when it happens when you’re running power- and resource-hungry programs like games and video editing software. To make sure that this is not the culprit why your computer restarts randomly, please try to change the power settings in this way:

1. Type **Power Options**  in the search box from Start. Then click**Edit power plan** or other items relates to power settings.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b79395b78b6.png)
2. Click **Change advanced power settings** .

3. In the**Balanced** section, click **Processor power management** \> **Minimum processor state** . Then set it to a small number, like**5%** or even**0%** . Click **Apply**  \> **OK** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b79482efc69.png)
4. Work on your computer for a while to see if it restarts randomly. If so, please move on.

## Fix 4: Run a memory check

 The fact your computer randomly restarts could mean there’s a problem with its Random Access Memory (RAM). Fortunately, Windows comes with a tool that can test your RAM and let you know if there are any issues with it. Here’s how to use it:

1. Press the **Windows logo key** and **R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Type **mdsched.exe** , then click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-22_15-53-32.jpg)
3. Click **Restart now and check for problems (recommended)** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 **IMPORTANT: Make sure to save all your work before restarting.**  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-22_15-53-57.jpg)
4. Windows will run diagnosis automatically, which can take a few minutes. When it’s finished, your PC will reboot.
5. The results will be shown on your desktop. If you don’t see any notification, right-click the **Start** menu then click **Event Viewer** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-22_15-54-28.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4615471&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/max_782x90.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-22_16-00-48.jpg)

 If you do see an error, you may consider replacing your RAM sticks. You will need to check if your device is still under warranty or consult your machine’s manufacturer for assistance if you’re not tech-savvy enough to do this on your own.

## Fix 5: Repair system files

 If you are facing persistent issues and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it’s possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that   **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 By repairing the core Windows system files, it may resolve conflicts, missing DLL issues, registry errors, and other problems that contribute to instability and lag in CS2\. Tools like **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  can automate the repair process by scanning system files and replacing corrupted ones.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you**a detailed report of your PC status** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-scan.jpg)
3. Once finished, you’ll see a report showing all the issues. To fix all the issues automatically, click**Start Repair** (You’ll need to purchase the full version. It comes with a**60-day Money-Back Guarantee** so you can refund anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-repair.jpg)

 The repair is available with the paid version of Fortect that comes with a full money-back guarantee and full technical support. If you need any assistance, feel free to contact their support team.

## Fix 6: Check power issue

 As mentioned above, an insufficient power supply is one of the most common reasons why your computer restarts automatically. This includes the power management options on your computer, and also your power supply unit or battery.

 In this case, you can try to**replace the power cables** and **power supply unit** (PSU) to see if your computer still keeps restarting. If so, please move on to check other possible hardware issues.

## Fix 7: Make sure the computer is not overheating

 Hardware components overheating is another common reason for computer restarting randomly problem.

 If you can feel the heat on your computer case or on your computer itself, or you can hear the fan(s) running very loud, you need a cooler environment for your machine to make sure that your computer doesn’t crash because of the heat.

 You can usually use free tools like [HWMonitor](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html) or [AIDA64](https://www.aida64.com/downloads) to tell whether your computer CPU, the CPU core, and the GPU are running too hot.
