## Mastering the Art of Fixing PS4 Microphone Failures – Top Strategies Inside

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a3093243a78b.jpg)

 When you are playing PS4 games, it would be a huge disappointment if your**PS4 mic is not working** , because you can’t normally chat with your partners. But don’t be worried! This article can help you fix the PS4 mic not working issue easily and quickly. Try these methods below until they solve your problem.

1. **[Check the hardware](#Method1)**
2. **[Update your sound card driver](#Method4)**
3. **[Check the PS4 settings](#Method2)**
4. **[Check the audio settings on your PC](#Method3)**
5. **[Replace with a PS4 microphone](#Method5)**

## **Method 1: Check the hardware**

 If others can’t hear you in the party chat, but you can hear them clearly, please check these possibilities below to troubleshoot your problem.

### **Check your headset**

 First of all, you need to check your headset’s cables and ports to see if they are working properly.

 Make sure that you**correctly plug the cables into the appropriate ports** . Make sure there are **no dust or obstacles** inside the ports that may prevent your device from working properly.

### **Check your mic boom**

 You may need to troubleshoot whether your problem lies in your headset with mic boom, so follow these two steps:

 1) Check**whether your mic boom is not loose** . Unplug your headset from your PS4 controller, then  disconnect the mic boom by pulling it straight out of the headset and plug the mic boom back in. Then re-plug your headset into your PS4 controller again.

 2)**Try your PS4 headset with a** mic on another device to see if it works normally. For example, plug your headset into your mobile phone, make a phone call with your mic, and see if it works well.

 If your headset and microphone are working normally, skip to[**method 2**](#Method4) .

 If your headset and microphone are not working well, it could be an issue with your mic boom, so you may need to replace it with a new mic boom. Or you can try this non-official but effective solution (this works for many users):

1) Connect your PS4 headset with mic into the PS4 controller.

2) Unplug your microphone halfway out from your controller, and plug it back in. Repeat this more than twice until you hear a sound like a buzz.

3) Try your PS4 mic again to see if it works.

## **Method 2: Update your sound card driver**

 If your microphone is not working when using it on a PC, you should update the audio driver to make sure there’s no problem communicating between the PC and the mic. There are two options to update your audio driver:[manually](#Way1) and[automatically](#Way2) .

**Manually update audio driver** – You should go to the website of your mic manufacturer, find the correct and latest sound driver for your device, and install it on your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

 **Automatically update audio driver** – If you don’t have time or computer skills to manually update drivers, you can do that automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will detect the drivers’ condition in your computer, and install the correct drivers for your PC. More importantly, with Driver Easy, you don’t need to struggle to figure out the Operating System, and you don’t need to worry about making mistakes while processing. That will tremendously save you time and patience.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or Pro version of Driver Easy. It only takes 2 simple clicks with the Pro version (and you will get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee).

 1) [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Then Driver Easy will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Driver-Easy-Scan-Needed.jpg)

3) Click the **Update button**  next to the driver name to download and install the correct driver (you can do that with the FREE version). Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of all the problem drivers (you can do that with the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and you will be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** ).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Driver-Easy-Update-audio-driver.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://bellelily.pxf.io/m5azgm) .**

 4) After updating the driver, restart your computer, then try your PS4 mic and see if your problem is solved.

## **Method 3: Check the PS4 settings**

 If you are sure that there is no problem with your mic boom and headset, it seems like an issue with your PS4 settings. Check the following steps to make sure that the PS4 settings are configured correctly.

 1) Go to the  **PS4** **Settings**  \>  **Devices**  \>  **Audio Devices** .

## **Method 4: Check the audio settings on your PC**

 To check your microphone,**plug your microphone into another computer** that works properly, and see if your microphone works or not.

 You can buy a new microphone to play PS4 games on the Internet. Be sure to choose a **[microphone](https://www.amazon.com/VersionTECH-Surround-Over-Ear-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B012DFI02O/ref=sr%5F1%5F4?ie=UTF8&qid=1541673913&sr=8-4&keywords=ps4+mic&tag=easeware-lillianlai-20)**  with high quality and reasonable price.
