### Fix 4: Disable unsupported programs

 Unsupported programs are among the most common causes of games-not-launching issues. This is also true with PUBG. To solve the problem, you need to remove or disable any programs unrelated to the game, and even turn off your antivirus temporarily.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows Logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type in **taskmgr** and hit **Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-296.png)

 2) Select the**Processes** tab. Right-click on the program that needs to be ended and click**End task** . If you don’t know which program should be shut down, simply close all the background running apps that you think are unnecessary.**Note** that you shouldn’t end any processes that you’re not familiar with in case you mistakenly close the important ones.

 As reported by many PUBG players,**MSI Afterburner** – an overclocking tool for MSI graphics cards – may be one of the culprits for the trouble. If you happen to be using this app, make sure you turn if off.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-13_10-51-43.png)

 If you find out any programs that trigger the issue, you can forward them to **[PUBG support](https://www.pubg.com/support/)**  .

 3) Your trouble is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily**disable your antivirus program** and check if the PUBG-not-launching issue persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If the game works properly after you disable the antivirus, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If this didn’t help, please try out the next fix.

### **Fix 5: Update your device drivers**

 Make sure you have the latest drivers for your PC components (such as CPU, GPU, and audio). Sometimes PUBG may fail to be launched because of an out-dated or corrupt driver, which is so inconspicuous that you may not even notice it until the problem occurs. If that’s the case, try to update your device drivers periodically.

 You may either download the most up-to-date drivers online and install them manually, or simply trust in **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and its abilities to update all your drivers automatically.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy takes care of everything.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE**  or the **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-96.png)

 3) Click the **Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download the correct version of the driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version). Then install the driver in your computer.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
