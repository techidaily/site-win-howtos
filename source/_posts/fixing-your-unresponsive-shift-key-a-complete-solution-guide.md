## Method 1: Check the status of your controller

 You should check the basic status of your controller and see if there is any issue that causes the problem.

**1)** Check the**connection status** of your controller: Make sure your wireless controller is **close enough** to the console. Ensure that there is no**objects (such as a wireless router or a microwave oven)** or**USB or wireless devices (such as a headset or a flash drive)** that may interfere in the connection.

**2)** Check the**battery status** of your controller: Make sure the **batteries are not running out of power** . If your controller is running low on power, charge or replace the batteries and see if this resolves the problem.

## Method 2: Re-sync your controller

 If you are using a**wireless** controller, you can try re-syncing your Xbox One controller to the console to fix connection issues.

**1)**  Press the**connect** button on your console.

**\*** On Xbox One S, the connect button is a small circular button on the front of the console. On other versions of Xbox One, it is on the side around the corner from the disc tray.

**2)**  Press and hold the**connect** button on the back of the controller till the**Xbox button flashes** . After a few seconds you can see it switch back to a**solid light** , which means it is re-synced.
