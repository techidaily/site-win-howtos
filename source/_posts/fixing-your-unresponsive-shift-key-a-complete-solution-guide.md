## Method 1: Check the status of your controller

 You should check the basic status of your controller and see if there is any issue that causes the problem.

**1)** Check the**connection status** of your controller: Make sure your wireless controller is **close enough** to the console. Ensure that there is no**objects (such as a wireless router or a microwave oven)** or**USB or wireless devices (such as a headset or a flash drive)** that may interfere in the connection.

**2)** Check the**battery status** of your controller: Make sure the **batteries are not running out of power** . If your controller is running low on power, charge or replace the batteries and see if this resolves the problem.

## Method 2: Re-sync your controller

 If you are using a**wireless** controller, you can try re-syncing your Xbox One controller to the console to fix connection issues.

**1)**  Press the**connect** button on your console.

**\*** On Xbox One S, the connect button is a small circular button on the front of the console. On other versions of Xbox One, it is on the side around the corner from the disc tray.

**2)**  Press and hold the**connect** button on the back of the controller till the**Xbox button flashes** . After a few seconds you can see it switch back to a**solid light** , which means it is re-synced.

 If this method works for you, the connection between your controller and your console will recover.

**1)** Plug the cable into a USB port on Xbox and connect with your controller.

**2)** Press and hold the Xbox button on the controller to sync them.

 Check to see your controller can connect to the console or not. You can unplug the cable after the whole process.
