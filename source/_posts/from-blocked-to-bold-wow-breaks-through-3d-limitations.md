### Fix 1: Update your device drivers

 One of the most common causes of this error is corrupted or outdated device drivers. So you should definitely try updating your drivers before trying anything more complicated. You can do this manually, if you like, by visiting each manufacturer’s download page, finding the right drivers, etc. But that takes time and computer skills. If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy, then click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
