## No Sound in Steam Games? Quick Troubleshooting Techniques Will Help

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-19.png)

 Vivid visual and auditory experiences play important roles in the joy of gameplay. A muted game seems far less immersive – however excellent the graphics rendering is – as if it has lost part of its soul. If you’re one of the**Steam users** struggling with**no-sound issues** in one or more games, you should check out this post and see whether it can get you out of trouble.

## How to fix Steam games have no sound

 Causes of the no-audio problem often boil down to software incompatibility, corrupted game files, or driver issues. No matter what reason it might be, this post will have you covered. There’re 5 fixes for you to repair this problem, but you don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

 Above all, you should check your volume mixer: first, run the problematic game and see if the volume mixer (you can open it from the sound icon at the bottom right corner of your taskbar) has been turned down low or muted; second, check the in-game audio settings to make sure they’re set up correctly.

### Fix 1: Run Steam & your game as administrator

You can run Steam as administrator either temporarily or permanently:

* **[Run as administrator temporarily](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Run as administrator permanently](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### **Run as administrator temporarily**

 After downloading and installing Steam, there’ll be a Steam icon on your desktop. If you see nothing there, simply search for the application in your Startup menu.

 When you successfully locate Steam, right-click on its icon and select**Run as administrator** . Very simple, right?

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-20.png)

#### **Run as administrator permanently**

 1) Locate Steam in your computer, right-click on its icon, and then select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-21.png)

 2) Click the**Compatibility** tab. Make sure you check the**Run this program as an administrator** box, and then click**Apply > OK** to save the change.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-22.png)

 3) The next time you open Steam, it’ll automatically run under administrative privileges.

 Running Steam as administrator is just the first step. Next you’re going to launch the problematic game under administrative privileges. Even if there’s a game icon on your desktop, you can’t use the same method as above to run the game. In this situation, you should launch it via Steam.

 1) Log in Steam. Then click**LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-23.png)

 2) Right-click on the problematic game. Then click**Properties** .

 3) On the next page, click the**LOCAL FILES** tab. Next, click**BROWSE LOCAL FILES…** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-25.png)

 4) In the pop-up window, right-click on the game’s executable file and select**Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-27.png)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-28.png)

 If you want to run the game as administrator permanently, please complete the following procedure:

 1) After locating the game executable, right-click on the file and select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-79.png)

 2) Go to the**Compatibility** tab. Make sure you check the**Run this program as an administrator** box, and then click**Apply > OK** to save the change.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-80.png)

 3) The next time you launch the game, it’ll automatically run under administrative privileges.

 There you go – now you just need to start the game and see whether your no-sound problem has been solved. If not, please move on to the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Verify integrity of game files

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-34.png)

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 Sometimes a corrupt or outdated audio driver may lead to your no-sound issue in games. If that’s the case, then you should try to update your sound card driver.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy takes care of everything.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):
