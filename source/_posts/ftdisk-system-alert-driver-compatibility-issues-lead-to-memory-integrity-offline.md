### Fix 3: Make sure your PC meets the minimum specifications

 If you have tried the above fixes but none seems to work, it’s perhaps worth considering whether or not your PC is equipped to play the game.

 Below I have listed both the minimum (for playable performance) and recommended (for optimal performance) requirements for Windows PC. You can check how your system measures up against these specifications.

| |  MINIMUM**SPECIFICATIONS** | RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS                                                                    |                                                                       |
