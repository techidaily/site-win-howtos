## 7 Fixes for bluetooth keyboard not working

 Here are 7 fixes that have helped other users fix their Bluetooth keyboard connection issues. You might not need to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

## Fix 3: Update your Bluetooth driver

 A faulty or outdated driver is one of the most common causes of Bluetooth keyboard not connecting. To see if that’s the case for you, you should update your Bluetooth driver to the latest version.

 You can manually update your Bluetooth driver by going to the manufacturer’s website, downloading the latest driver, and then installing it.

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 **Driver Easy is a driver update tool that can automatically identify and download all the drivers you need.** You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong drivers, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

Here’s how it works:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/de-scan-now-3.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is download them one at a time and manually install them.)
