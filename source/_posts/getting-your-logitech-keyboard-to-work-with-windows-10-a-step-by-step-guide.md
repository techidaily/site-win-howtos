## 7 Fixes for bluetooth keyboard not working

 Here are 7 fixes that have helped other users fix their Bluetooth keyboard connection issues. You might not need to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Check your Bluetooth keyboard](#Fix1)**
2. **[Check your PC](#Fix2)**
3. **[Update your Bluetooth driver](#Fix3)**
4. **[Remove and re-pair your Bluetooth keyboard](#Fix4)**
5. **[Restart Bluetooth Support Service](#Fix5)**
6. **[Run the Bluetooth troubleshooter](#Fix6)**
7. **[Test your Bluetooth keyboard on another computer](#Fix7)**

## Fix 1: Check your Bluetooth keyboard

 **Your Bluetooth keyboard can stop working if the batteries are worn out or not installed properly.** To test the batteries, you can simply replace them with brand new ones or recharge the batteries by connecting the charging cable to a power source.

 If your keyboard has an**On/Off** switch, make sure it’s set to**On** . Try turning off your keyboard and then turning it on to see if that fixes your problem.

 **Make sure your Bluetooth keyboard is discoverable and in range of the PC you need to connect to.** Remove other USB devices as these might interfere with Bluetooth connections.

## Fix 2: Check your PC

 The airplane mode on your computer can automatically turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. So you should make sure airplane mode is turned off and Bluetooth is turned on. Here’s how:

### in Windows 10

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. In Windows Settings, click**Network & Internet** .

 If airplane mode is already set to Off, try turning off Bluetooth, waiting a few seconds, and then turning it back on.

## Fix 3: Update your Bluetooth driver

 A faulty or outdated driver is one of the most common causes of Bluetooth keyboard not connecting. To see if that’s the case for you, you should update your Bluetooth driver to the latest version.

 You can manually update your Bluetooth driver by going to the manufacturer’s website, downloading the latest driver, and then installing it.
