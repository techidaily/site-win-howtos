1. Open Chrome.
2. On the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **More tools** \> **clear browsing data** .

4. Run Chrome and hopefully the**Google Chrome not responding** problem has been sorted. If yes, then great! But if the issue persists, you should try**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Turn off Chrome add-ons

 Add-ons are extensions to Chrome that allow you to do more things in your browser, or which improve your  user experience. For example, the AdBlock add-on blocks ads. Extensions are sometimes added manually and sometimes added by other programs on your computer (hopefully with your permission).

 If you have too many add-ons, they can may overload your browser and cause the **Google Chrome not responding**  issue.

1. Open Chrome.
2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **More tools** \> **Extensions** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b432bba1ea5a.jpg)
3. Toggle off all the extensions on your Chrome.

4. **Restart**  your computer and check if**Google Chrome**  now works:

* If Google Chrome does respond after disabling all your add-ons, it’s likely one of your add-ons was the problem. Now you just need to figure out which one. To do this, enable the first add-on in the list, then see if Google Chrome still works. If it doesn’t, then you’ve found the cause of the problem. If Google Chrome works fine after enabling the first add-on, enable the second and test again. Continue testing each add-on in this way until you find the one that stops Internet Explorer from working. Once you find it, disable it again. If you need it, contact the vendor for support.
* If disabling your add-ons doesn’t solve the **Chrome not responding**  issue, please try **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 5: Update or reinstall Chrome

2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **help** \>**About Google Chrome** .

3. Google Chrome automatically detects if there’s an update available:  
   * If yes, follow the on-screen instruction to finish the update.  
   * If no, delete Chrome and re-install it on Windows store or other trustworthy third-party website. (**NOTE** : This will erase your Chrome browser settings and data)
4. Check if the**Google** **Chrome not responding** issue has been resolved.
