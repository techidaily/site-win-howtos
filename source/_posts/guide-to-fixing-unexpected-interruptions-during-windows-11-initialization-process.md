1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog. Then type**ncpa.cpl** and click**OK** .

### Fix 3: Update your Wi-Fi adapter driver

 **One of the main causes of the Wi-Fi option not showing up is that you’re using a corrupted or outdated wireless adapter driver.** To ensure your Wi-Fi network works properly, you need to update your Wi-Fi adapter driver to the latest version.

 You can go to the manufacturer’s website, search for the latest driver for your wireless network adapter, and then download and install it manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

### Fix 5: Turn on WLAN AutoConfig service

 WLAN AutoConfig is a Windows service that helps your computer to configure, discover, connect to, and disconnect from a wireless network. If this service is disabled, your Wi-Fi won’t work. So you should make sure the WLAN AutoConfig service is running automatically. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together to invoke the Run dialog. Then type**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/windows11-services.jpg)
2. Find**WLAN AutoConfig** in the list of services, right-click on it and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wlan-autoconfig-properties.jpg)
3. Make sure**Startup type** is set to**Automatic** and**Service status** is**Running** . Then click**OK** to save changes.
