## Fix 1: Install the latest Microsoft Visual C++

 To work properly, most newer games need the latest version of Microsoft Visual C++. And there is a possibility that some of your Visual C++ Redistributables files are missing and that causes the crashing issue. So you should [download](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) and install the latest ones, both ×86 and ×64.

## Fix 2: Try Windowed mode

 When playing games on PC, you can generally choose between Windowed, Borderless, and Fullscreen display modes.

 When your game runs in Fullscreen mode, it has full control over the screen output, meaning that what it’s showing has the highest priority. But with some many resources dedicated to the game, it may crash. So if you’re playing in Fullscreen mode, you can try to switch to Windowed mode.

 1) Open your Steam client. Select the**LIBRARY** tab. Navigate to your game**Halo: The Master Chief Collection** . Right-click it and select**Properties** .

 2) Under the**GENERAL** tab, click on**SET LAUNCH OPTIONS…** .  
  
![switch to Windowed mode Halo 4 UE4 Fatal Error set launch options](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switch-to-Windowed-mode-Halo-4-UE4-Fatal-Error.jpg)

 3) In the box, type**\-windowed** . (Remember the**hyphen –** .) Then click**OK** .

](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switch-to-Windowed-mode-Halo-4-UE4-Fatal-Error-type-windowed.jpg)

 After applying the changes, try and launch your game to check if the error message still pops up. If you’re still facing the same issue, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Verify the integrity of game files

 If some of your game files are corrupt or missing, you would encounter issues with running the game. To fix it, you can verify the integrity of game files.

 Before verifying the integrity of game files, you need to delete the content in the MCC folder.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Type **%userprofile%AppDataLocalLow** , then press **Enter**  on your keyboard.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/delete-the-content-from-MCC-folder.jpg)

 3) Then open the**MCC** folder. Before deleting all the files in this folder, make sure you have a backup in case something happens. You can simply select all the files (Ctrl+A) and then copy them to a new folder.

 4) After you’ve made a backup, delete all the files inside the**MCC** folder.

 5) Now open your Steam client, and select the**LIBRARY** tab. Navigate to your game**Halo: The Master Chief Collection** . Right-click it and select**Properties** .  
  
![switch to Windowed mode Halo 4 UE4 Fatal Error](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switch-to-Windowed-mode-select-Properties.jpg)

 6) When the game’s**Properties** window opens, select the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES** .

## Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics driver is an essential piece of software that lets your system communicate with the graphics card. If it is outdated, it would cause noticeable performance problems. Therefore, when you experience random crashes when playing Halo, whether, with error messages or not, you should make sure your graphics card is up-to-date.

 To update your graphics driver, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or head to the manufacturer’s driver download page ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) / [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) to download and install the exact driver for your system. However, if you don’t have the time, or patience to update drivers manually, you can instead do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s an automatic driver updater tool that detects any outdated drivers, and downloads and installs the latest drivers for your system.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with missing or outdated drivers.

## Fix 5: Run your game on a dedicated graphics card

 The integrated graphics chipset is built into the processor and makes sure that your computer can use a display even without a dedicated GPU. However, more demanding tasks such as gaming require a stronger GPU, which in most cases is the dedicated one.

 The biggest benefit of a dedicated GPU is performance. Not only does a dedicated graphics card have sophisticated RAM for the task of processing video, but also has dedicated RAM for the task, which is typically faster and better optimized for the task than your general system RAM.

### Find out if your computer has more than one GPU

 If you’re not sure how many GPUs your computer has, follow the instructions below:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Type **devmgmt.msc**  and press **Enter** .

![open Device Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/open-device-manager.png)

 3) Double-click **Display adapters**  to expand the list. And you can see if your computer has more than one GPU.

## Fix 6: Disable overclocking and overlays

 If you’re using MSI Afterburner or other GPU tweaking programs, you cannot play your game smoothly. The game engine doesn’t really support cards that are overclocked. And overclocking can be causing game instability and thus the game might crash. So to fix it, you should disable it.

 Also, it’s very important to remove all those overlays, Steam, Discord, or whatever overlay you’re using. It’s usually causing some issues like crashing and thus affecting your performance.

 You can disable overlays on [Steam](#DisableSteamOverlay) , [Geforce Experience](#DisableGeforceExperienceOverlay) and [Discord](#DisableDiscordOverlay) by following the instructions below:

### Disable Steam overlay

 1) Open your Steam client, and select the**LIBRARY** tab. Navigate to your game**Halo: The Master Chief Collection** . Right-click it and select**Properties** .

![disable Steam overlay Halo 4 UE4 Fatal Error](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/switch-to-Windowed-mode-select-Properties.jpg)

 2) Under the **GENERAL** tab, uncheck the box **Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
  
![disable Steam overlay Halo 4](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/disable-Steam-overlay.jpg)

 After applying the changes, exit Steam and run your game to see if this fixed the issue.
