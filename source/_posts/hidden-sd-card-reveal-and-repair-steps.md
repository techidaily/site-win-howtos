### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 Manufacturers such as NVIDIA and AMD keep releasing new drivers to fix known bugs and improve overall performance. Outdated graphics cards are known to have issues on three monitor setups, so make sure you have the latest graphics card driver installed.

 To update your graphics driver, you can always have 2 options –**[Manually](https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/b0rbxy)** or**[Automatically](https://newchic.sjv.io/jzg4zq)** .

#### Option 1 – Manually

 To update your graphics driver manually, you need to visit the manufacturer’s official website to download the exact driver for your device and install it manually.

##### Method 1: Update your graphics driver via Device Manager

1. Open Device Manager.
2. Expand**Display adapters** and right-click your graphics card.
3. Select**Update driver** \>**Search automatically for updated driver software.**
4. Windows will find the latest driver and install it for you automatically.

 However, Windows cannot always find the latest driver for you, so you can head to the manufacturer’s website to download the latest driver and manually install it or do it automatically in**[Option 2](#o2)** .

##### Method 2: Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website

1. Head to the official website of the manufacturer and download the latest driver.  
   * For NVIDIA: Go to NVIDIA Official Website:[NVIDIA Driver Downloads](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)  
   * For AMD: Go to AMD Official Website:[AMD Drivers and Support](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
2. Double click the downloaded driver file and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the install.
3. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

#### Option 2 – Automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **All the drivers in Driver Easy come straight from the manufacturer.**

 Here’s a step-by-step guide to automatically updating your graphics driver with Driver Easy:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DE-scan-now-6.0.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you’re not ready to buy the Pro version, Driver Easy offers a 7-day free trial which includes access to all the Pro features such as high-speed download and one-click install. You won’t be charged until the trial ends.)

 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://bellelily.pxf.io/m5azgm) .**

### Fix 5: Rollback your graphics driver

 If re-enabling your graphics driver failed to work, then the graphics driver may be at fault. You can roll back the graphics driver if you’ve made any changes recently. Sometimes the latest drivers don’t work properly. But if you didn’t perform any updates lately, you can skip to**[Fix 5](#f5)** to update your graphics driver instead.

1. Open**Device Manager** .
2. Expand the**Display adapters** , right-click your graphics driver, and select**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/properties.jpg)
3. Go to the**Driver** tab and click**Roll Back Driver** , then follow the on-screen instructions to complete.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/roll-back-driver-1.jpg)
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

> **Note:** _If the_ **_Roll Back Driver_**   _option is grayed out, it means there is no driver version that Windows can roll back to. This doesn’t mean it’s impossible to roll back the driver, just that you won’t be able to do it from the built-in option. You can download a previous graphics driver from the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card and install it manually, or try the following fix._

### Fix 6\. Repair your PC

 It’s very likely that there’re some issues that are really hard to detect. The most common issues are corrupt, damaged, or missing system files. Here’s how:

1. **[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](#reimage)**  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of the third monitor not working. It will deal with issues related to system errors, critical system files and find the right fix for you.
2. **[Option 2 – Manually](https://ukaidot.sjv.io/daqnoj)**  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there’re any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your computer and fix them immediately.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-3.jpg)

#### Option 2 – Manually

 To check and restore your system file might take time and computer skills. You will need to run numerous commands, wait for the process to complete, or risk your personal data.

##### Step 1\. Scan**corrupt files with System File Checker**

 System File Checker (SFC) is a Windows built-in tool to identify and repair corrupted system files.

 1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and R at the same time to open the Run box. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2067133&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/gcb/banScrn.jpg" border="0">Greeting Card Builder</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cmd-1.jpg)

 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt, type the following command and hit**Enter** .

sfc /scannow

 3) System File Check will begin to scan all system files and repair any corrupted or missing ones it detected. This may take 3-5 minutes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/scan-now.jpg)

 4) You may receive something like the following messages after the verification.

* no errors
* it fixed some errors
* could not fix all errors
* could not fix errors at all
* ……

 No matter what message you receive, you can try running**dism.exe** (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) to further scan the health of your PC.

##### Step 2.**Run dism.exe**

1) Run Command Prompt as admin and enter the following commands.

* This command line will scan the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

* This command line will restore the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

 2) After the restore health process finishes, you may get some error messages.

* If restore heath gave you errors, you can always try this command line. This will take up to 2 hours.

dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

* If you get **Error: 0x800F081F** with the restore health scan, reboot your PC and run this command line.

Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore

 Restart your PC after repairing the corrupt files, and check if the issue still persists. If everything works out just fine, then congrats!

## Good to go?

 If the fixes above don’t work for you, contact your computer or motherboard manufacturer or google your graphics model + 3 monitors. Determine if your model supports three displays and what configurations are required.

 Also, check the ports on your laptop, for the monitors should have the corresponding ports as well. Otherwise, you will need to buy an extra adapter, such as a **[DVI to HDMI adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Rankie-Adapter-2-Pack-Gold-Plated-Converter/dp/B00ZMVGTA2/?tag=drivereasycom-20)**  or **[HDMI to DVI](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Input-Output-Adapter-Cable/dp/B014I8UQJY/?tag=drivereasycom-20)**  to have them match.
