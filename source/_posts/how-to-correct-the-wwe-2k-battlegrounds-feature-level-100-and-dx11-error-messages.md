## 2\. Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card is an important hardware that decides whether your computer can run games smoothly. And the graphics driver acts as an interpreter between Windows and your device. If the driver is outdated or corrupted, you may run into any sorts of problems which can ultimately prevent your game from launching. Therefore, to ensure that you can enjoy your game, you should update your graphics driver:

 There are two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://uperfect.sjv.io/g1jgba) and **[automatically](https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/jrkzxp)** .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can manually update your graphics driver by going to the manufacturer’s official websites:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)

### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 However, updating drivers on your own can be error-prone and it’s time-consuming. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can instead do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and all your devices, and install the latest correct drivers for you – direct from the manufacturer. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong drivers, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with missing or outdated drivers.

![update drivers automatically](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-driver-easy-1.png)

 3) Click **Update All** . Driver Easy will then download and update all your outdated and missing device drivers, giving you the latest version of each, direct from the device manufacturer.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version.

 After updating your drivers, restart your PC and launch your game to check if your problem has been resolved. If updating the graphics driver didn’t do the trick, try the next fix below.

## 3\. Install the newest version of DirectX

 If your Windows is up to date, the latest DirectX will automatically be integrated into your system. For Windows 10 users, you should have DirectX12 and should also be able to run DirectX11 and DirectX10\. But for some reasons, you may not have the latest DirectX installed on your Windows. In this case, you need to install the newest version of DirectX by visiting the[DirectX download page](download-directx) .

## 4\. Uninstall Vanguard

 Riot Vanguard is designed to set both game safety and personal computer safety as a priority. However, it has the capability of blocking drivers and certain components in your computer will not be working when you’re playing Valorant. And that could be the reason why you would get the error message. To troubleshoot the issue, you can try uninstalling Vanguard:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows + I** keys simultaneously to open Settings.

 2) Click**Apps** .
