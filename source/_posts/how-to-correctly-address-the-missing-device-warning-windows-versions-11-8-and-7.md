 If your Wi-Fi adapter is disabled, the Wi-Fi option may not show up. To see if that’s the case, you can check your network settings. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog. Then type**ncpa.cpl** and click**OK** .

 Once done, restart your computer and check if your Wi-Fi network shows up again.

 If your Wi-Fi adapter is enabled and the issue remains, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your Wi-Fi adapter driver

 **One of the main causes of the Wi-Fi option not showing up is that you’re using a corrupted or outdated wireless adapter driver.** To ensure your Wi-Fi network works properly, you need to update your Wi-Fi adapter driver to the latest version.

 You can go to the manufacturer’s website, search for the latest driver for your wireless network adapter, and then download and install it manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 Or click the**Update** button to download the latest wireless adapter driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

### Fix 5: Turn on WLAN AutoConfig service

 WLAN AutoConfig is a Windows service that helps your computer to configure, discover, connect to, and disconnect from a wireless network. If this service is disabled, your Wi-Fi won’t work. So you should make sure the WLAN AutoConfig service is running automatically. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together to invoke the Run dialog. Then type**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/windows11-services.jpg)
2. Find**WLAN AutoConfig** in the list of services, right-click on it and select**Properties** .

 Once you’ve run all those commands, restart your computer and try to connect to the Wi-Fi network.

If this method doesn’t help, try the last fix below.

### Fix 7: Reset your network

 If you’ve tried all of the above steps and you still can’t get your Wi-Fi to work, the last thing you can try is to reset your network. This will remove and then reinstall all your network adapters and the settings for them will be set to the defaults. To do so:

1. On your taskbar, select the**Start** button and click**Settings** .
