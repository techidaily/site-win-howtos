### Fix 1: Check the Sticky Keys feature

 The Sticky Keys feature enables you to press one key at a time for keyboard shortcuts. As a lot of users reported, the disable Sticky Keys feature helps them save their spacebar back to life. So when you find your spacebar not functioning, the first quick fix you can try is to check the Sticky Keys.

 1) Press the**Windows** key + **I** key together to open the Settings Window.  
 Then scroll down to find and click **Ease of Access** .

 2) Click **Keyboard** on the left pane. Then check the icon of Sticky Keys. If it’s **on** , set it to be**off** .

 If after making sure the Sticky Keys feature is disabled, you still cannot use your spacebar, try other methods below. The spacebar not working error is probably due to its driver issues. Rolling back its driver to an earlier version or doing a clean install for its driver helps many users fix the issue. You can try to do so.

 3) Choose to view on**Driver** pane. Then click the**Roll Back Driver** icon.

**Note:** If the Roll Back Driver icon is grayed out, you can choose to download the driver of an earlier version from your keyboard manufacturer’s website.

## Method 3\. Do a clean install for your keyboard driver

 If unluckily, rolling back your keyboard driver still cannot save your spacebar back to work, then do a clean install for it.

 1) Follow the step 1) & 2) in Method 2 to open the**Device Manager** window and locate your keyboard driver.

 2) Right-click on your keyboard driver. Then choose**Uninstall device** .

3) Reboot your Windows 10 to let Windows reinstall your keyboard driver.

 If Windows doesn’t reinstall the driver, you can download the latest driver from your keyboard manufacturer’s website.
