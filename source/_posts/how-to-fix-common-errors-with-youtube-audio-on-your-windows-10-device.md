## **Method 3 : Update the USB Driver**

 The problem can be caused by a faulty USB driver. In this case, updating the driver would fix the problem.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):
