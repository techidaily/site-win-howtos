## Fix 1: Check your Bluetooth keyboard

 **Your Bluetooth keyboard can stop working if the batteries are worn out or not installed properly.** To test the batteries, you can simply replace them with brand new ones or recharge the batteries by connecting the charging cable to a power source.

 If your keyboard has an**On/Off** switch, make sure it’s set to**On** . Try turning off your keyboard and then turning it on to see if that fixes your problem.

 **Make sure your Bluetooth keyboard is discoverable and in range of the PC you need to connect to.** Remove other USB devices as these might interfere with Bluetooth connections.

## Fix 3: Update your Bluetooth driver

 A faulty or outdated driver is one of the most common causes of Bluetooth keyboard not connecting. To see if that’s the case for you, you should update your Bluetooth driver to the latest version.

 You can manually update your Bluetooth driver by going to the manufacturer’s website, downloading the latest driver, and then installing it.

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 **Driver Easy is a driver update tool that can automatically identify and download all the drivers you need.** You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong drivers, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is download them one at a time and manually install them.)
