 You donâ€™t have to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

2. **[Enable the Wi-Fi adapter](#Fix2)**
3. **[Update your Wi-Fi adapter driver](#Fix3)**
4. **[Run the Network Adapter troubleshooter](#Fix4)**
5. **[Turn on WLAN AutoConfig service](#Fix5)**
6. **[Run network commands](#Fix6)**

### Fix1: Power cycle your computer

 The Wi-Fi option missing issue could be caused by a random bug on your Windows 11 PC. To fix the problem, **try to shut down your system, wait a few minutes, and then boot it again** . It sounds simple but does work for many users.

If you havenâ€™t tried this method before, give it a go.

### Fix 2: Enable the Wi-Fi adapter

 If your Wi-Fi adapter is disabled, the Wi-Fi option may not show up. To see if thatâ€™s the case, you can check your network settings. Hereâ€™s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog. Then type**ncpa.cpl** and click**OK** .

 Once done, restart your computer and check if your Wi-Fi network shows up again.

 If your Wi-Fi adapter is enabled and the issue remains, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your Wi-Fi adapter driver

 **One of the main causes of the Wi-Fi option not showing up is that youâ€™re using a corrupted or outdated wireless adapter driver.** To ensure your Wi-Fi network works properly, you need to update your Wi-Fi adapter driver to the latest version.

 You can go to the manufacturerâ€™s website, search for the latest driver for your wireless network adapter, and then download and install it manually. But if you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all** .

### Fix 4: Run the Network Adapter troubleshooter

 If updating the Wi-Fi adapter driver doesnâ€™t help, try running the Network Adapter troubleshooter. This troubleshooter can help diagnose and fix problems with your wireless and other network adapters. To run the troubleshooter:

1. On your taskbar, select the**Start** button and click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/windows11-start-settings.jpg)
2. Under System, select**Troubleshoot** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/win11-troubleshoot.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/win11-network-adapter-run.jpg)
5. Follow the steps in the troubleshooter and see if that fixes the problem.

If your issue persists, check out the next fix.

### Fix 5: Turn on WLAN AutoConfig service

 WLAN AutoConfig is a Windows service that helps your computer to configure, discover, connect to, and disconnect from a wireless network. If this service is disabled, your Wi-Fi wonâ€™t work. So you should make sure the WLAN AutoConfig service is running automatically. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together to invoke the Run dialog. Then type**services.msc** and click**OK** .

### Fix 6: Run network commands

 When youâ€™re having trouble with your wireless network, you can try running some network commands to manually reset the TCP/IP stack, release and renew the IP address, and flush and reset the DNS client resolver cache. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog. Then type**cmd** and press**Ctrl** ,**Shift,** and**Enter** simultaneously to run**Command Prompt** as administrator.
