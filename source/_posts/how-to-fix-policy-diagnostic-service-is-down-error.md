net localgroup Administrators /add networkservice  
  
net localgroup Administrators /add localservice

 net localgroup Administrators /add network service  
 net localgroup Administrators /add local service

 You should see a message saying**The command completed successfully** after each.

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact network adapter, and your variant of Windows system, and it will download and install them correctly:
