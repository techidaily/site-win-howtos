## Method 5: Update your drivers

 The kernel32.dll error may be caused by corrupted hardware drivers. Updating drivers not only fix the error but also improves your computer performance.  
 There are two ways you can get the right drivers: manually or automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](#op1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 –** Download and install the driver manually

 Devices keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and **R** key at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type “cmd” and press **Shift+Ctrl+Enter** together to open **Command Prompt** in the administrator mode.  
**Note** : Do **NOT** click OK or just press the Enter key as that won’t allow you to open Command Prompt in the administrator mode.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/command-prompt-1.jpg)
3. Type the following command line and press the **Enter** key on your keyboard.  
**chkdsk x: /f**  
**Note** : The letter “x” means the disk drive that you want to scan and repair for. The tool is often used for the Windows installation drive which is usually C drive. If you want to scan and repair C drive, replace “x” with “c”.
