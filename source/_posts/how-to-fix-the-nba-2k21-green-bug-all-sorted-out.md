## 3\. Update your graphics drivers

 our graphics driver is an essential piece of software that lets your system communicate with the graphics card. If it is outdated, it would cause noticeable performance problems. While driver updates include the latest patches for security flaws, fix problems, and sometimes even provide you with completely new features, all for free. Therefore, in order to enjoy your game to the fullest, you should make sure your graphics card is up-to-date.

 To update your graphics driver, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or head to the manufacturer’s driver download page ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) / [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) to download and install the exact driver for your system. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.
