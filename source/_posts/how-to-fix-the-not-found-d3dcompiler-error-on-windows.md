### **Method 4: Reset TCP/IP on your Windows**

 TCP/IP is the short term for**Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol** , and used as a communication protocol in the private network. They are responsible for different parts when processing the Internet connection. TCP defines how the programs can create the communication channels through a network, while IP is responsible for the address of each packet and make sure it is sent to the correct destination.

 To solve error 651, you can also try to reset TCP/IP to reconnect to the Windows network stack.

 1) Type**cmd** in the search box of the task bar. Right click**Command Prompt** (If you are using Windows 7, right click**cmd** ) to select**Run as administrator** . Then click**Yes** to confirm.
