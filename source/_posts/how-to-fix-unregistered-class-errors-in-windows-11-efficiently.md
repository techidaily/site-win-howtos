## Windows 11 No Speakers Error? Here's How You Can Fix It

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/no-audio-output-device-is-installed-win-10.jpg)

 When the sound icon in your taskbar has a red x on it (as illustrated above), your computer won’t play any sound.

 This is usually caused by one of two problems: either Windows has disabled your audio device or your PC doesn’t have the latest correct device drivers installed, and Windows therefore can’t ‘talk’ to the device.

 If you see**No Audio Output Device is installed** when you hover your mouse over the the sound icon, your audio problem is probably caused by one of these issues, and there are three repair methods you can try that have helped other users. You may not need to try them all; just start at the top of the list and work your way down.

1. [**Automatically update your audio device drivers**](#m1)
2. [**Manually uninstall & reinstall the device driver**](#m2)
3. **[Re-enable the device](#m3)**

## **Method 1: Automatically update your audio device drivers**

 Your sound problem is probably being caused by driver issues. If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the drivers manually,  you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to a flagged audio driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

## **Method 2: Manually uninstall & reinstall the device driver**

 If a driver update doesn’t fix your issue, try to reinstall your audio driver:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box. Then type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter to open the Device Manager.

 2) Restart your PC. After restarting, Windows should automatically re-install the sound driver. Assuming it installs the latest correct driver, this may resolve the problem.
