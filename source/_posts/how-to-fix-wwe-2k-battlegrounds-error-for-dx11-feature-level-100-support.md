4. Once done, run Apex Legends and see if the Easy Anti-Cheat error has been resolved. If it’s no joy, please continue with**Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: Run Apex Legends and Origin as Administrator

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4: Verify connectivity to Easy Anti-Cheat

 You may encounter this error is Easy Anti-Cheat isn’t properly connected. To verify your connectivity to Easy Anti-Cheat, navigate to these two sites:

* [https://download.eac-cdn.com/](https://download.eac-cdn.com/)
* [https://download-alt.easyanticheat.net/](https://download-alt.easyanticheat.net/)

**If you see the 200 – HTTP OK message** , it means your connection to Easy Anti-Cheat is healthy. You can rule this out as a possible cause and move on to Fix 6 to continue troubleshooting.

**If you’re not presented with the message** , then something is blocking your Internet connection. You can move on to**Fix 5** to check if your firewall is the culprit, if not, you should contact your Internet Service Provider to locate the problem.

### Fix 5: Add Easy Anti-Cheat and Apex Legends to your firewall exceptions list

 A firewall is a network security system that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic by permitting/blocking specific traffic based on a set of security rules. You should allow Easy Anti-Cheat and Apex Legends through the firewall to make sure that the connection isn’t lost.

 To make sure you allow these programs to communicate through Windows Defender Firewall:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then type**control firewall.cpl** into the box and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/run.png)
2. In the window that pops up, click**Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-13.png)
3. Browse through the list of Allowed apps and features to see if Easy Anti-Cheat and Apex Legends are included. If not, click**Change settings** , click**Allow another app…** , then follow the on-screen instructions to add the apps.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Snap5.png)
4. Once completed, click**OK** .
5. Check to see if the error still occurs. If it doesn’t, then congrats! If it’s still happening, please move on to**Fix 6** , below.

 If you have anti-virus software running in your computer, make sure you disable it temporarily too. While the role of an anti-virus program is hardly questionable, it’s known to conflict with other programs, rendering games unplayble.
