 Failed to initialize renderer

When you are going to play games, such as**Skyrim**on Steam, you may run into the error**Failed to initialize renderer**, which is totally a disappointment, right? Don’t worry! This is not a difficult issue to fix. Whether you’re getting the error like:**Failed to initialize renderer**, or**Failed to init render module**, you can try the solutions in this article to fix it.

## How do I fix Failed to initialize renderer?

You can try the following three methods to fix the error. You don’t need to try them all; Just work your way down until it fixes your problem.

1. [**Restart your computer**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Install the latest patches**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update the graphics card driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. **[Validating master files for your game](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Why does the error Failed to initialize renderer occur?

Rendering or image synthesis is the automatic process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D by means of computer programs, and the result of the displaying such a model can be called a render. When launching the game, the game engine would check your video card details, and see what it is capable of supporting. After that, the game engine decides what things to initialize for it. If it fails, it means that the game can not read your video card properly. So it’s probably due to the**graphics card driver problem**.

### **Solution 3: Update the graphics card driver**

As mentioned above, Failed to initialize renderer can be caused by the graphics card driver issue, as the graphics card driver is quite important for inter-communicating between the video card and the games and programs. So if the graphics card driver is missing or outdated, you’ll receive this error message.**Updating the graphics card driver**can effectively solve the issue. There are two ways to update the graphics card driver:[**Manually update the graphics card driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [**Automatically update the graphics card driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### Manually update graphics card driver

You can also go to the **manufacturer website**  of your graphics card, and find the correct driver that matches with your Windows OS and processor type, then install it in your computer, which requires the time ans computer skills.

#### Automatically update the graphics card driver

### **Solutions 4: Validating master files for your game**

It’s likely that your graphics settings are high, or your files are set as read only, so it prevents your game from updating your graphics settings. You can try validating master files for your game to fix it. 1) Close the game and Steam, then go to Steam folder and remove folder named **appcache**  . Steam will create a new folder later later when you open it, please don’t worry.2) Go to the folder of the game that gives the error. It’s normally in**C drive > Users> Your Name > Documents > My games**, or in**Documents > My games**, then click the file that is named with the game. For example, if it’s Skyrim that gives the error of Failed to initialize renderer, you can open the file named Skyrim in Document > My games > Skyrim.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/img_5a796404e5c46.png)

3) Delete the .ini files named with**XXX.ini**and**XXXPrefs.ini**. Take Skyrim as an example, you can delete the files named**Skyrim.ini**and**SkyrimPrefs.ini**.
