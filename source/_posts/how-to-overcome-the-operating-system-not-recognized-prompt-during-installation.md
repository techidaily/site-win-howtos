2. On your keyboard, type the command lines below one by one and press **Enter** .  
   1. Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth  
         * When you run the command mentioned above, the DISM tool will scan all the system files and compare them with official system files. The function of this command line is to see if the system file on your PC is consistent with its official source or not. This command line doesn’t fix the corruption.  
         ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Snap29.jpg)  
          It may take several minutes for this command operation to be completed.  
   2. Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth  
         * When you run the command line**Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth** , the DISM tool will check whether your Windows 10 image exists corruptions or not. This command line also doesn’t repair the corrupted files.  
         ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Snap28.jpg)  
          It may take several minutes for this command operation to be completed.  
   3. **Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth**  
         * The command line**Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth** tells the DISM tool to try to repair the corrupted files detected. It will replace the corrupted files with the files from official source online.  
         ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Snap27.jpg)  
          It may take several minutes for this command operation to be completed.

Type **cmd** and then press **Ctrl** ,**Shift** , and **Enter** on your keyboard   at the same time to**run the Command Prompt as administrator** . You will be prompted for permission.

   * sfc /scannow
