2. On your keyboard, type the command lines below one by one and press **Enter** .  
   1. Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth  
         * When you run the command mentioned above, the DISM tool will scan all the system files and compare them with official system files.

         ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Snap29.jpg)  
          It may take several minutes for this command operation to be completed.  
   2. Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth  
         * When you run the command line**Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth** , the DISM tool will check whether your Windows 10 image exists corruptions or not. This command line also doesn’t repair the corrupted files.  
         ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Snap28.jpg)  
          It may take several minutes for this command operation to be completed.  
   3. **Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth**  
         * The command line**Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth** tells the DISM tool to try to repair the corrupted files detected. It will replace the corrupted files with the files from official source online.  
         ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Snap27.jpg)  
          It may take several minutes for this command operation to be completed.
