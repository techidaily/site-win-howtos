 The error can be caused by hardware issues. So first, follow below simple instructions to do the troubleshooting.

**1\. Connect the device to your PC using another USB cable.** This may work like a charm on solving the problem.

**2\. Try the device on a different USB port.** This will figure out if problem is caused by a broken port.
**3\. Connect the device to another PC.** This will figure out if the external device has problem.

 If there is no problem with the USB cable, USB port and the device, read on and try the following solutions.

**Solution 1: Uninstall the USB Drivers**

Follow these steps:

 1\. Open[Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and expand category**Universal Serial Bus Controllers** .  
 2\. Right-click on**Unknown USB Device (Port Reset Failed)** under this category and then click **Uninstall** to remove the device.

 5\. Repeat the steps above to update driver software for every Generic USB Hub until the problem is resolved.

 If the problem persists, go to your PC manufacturer’s website to download the latest USB driver according to the PC model and the operating system that you are using.

 **5\. Change Power Management Setting**

 The Power Management would also be the reason causing the USB problem. Windows is set to shut down your USB controller to save power by default, sometimes it won’t be able to power it back up. So try following steps to prevent Windows from “managing” power to your USB controller or the devices.

Follow below steps.

1. In Device Manager, under category “Universal Serial Bus controllers”,  
 Double-click the “USB Root Hub” device, and go to the **Power Management**  tab. (if there’s more than one USB Root Hub device, repeat these steps for each one.)

2\. Turn off the **Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power** option, and click **OK** .
