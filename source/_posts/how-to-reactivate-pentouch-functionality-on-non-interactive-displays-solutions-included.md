## Fix 3: Update your wireless network adapter driver

 This problem could be also caused by an old or incorrect wireless network adapter driver on your computer. If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually,  you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 This process requires network access on your computer. You can connect your computer to the wired network or you can use the **[Offline Scan](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  feature of Driver Easy to update drivers.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE**   or the **Pro**   version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):
