Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version. **Automatic driver update –** If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your display driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact display card, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:
