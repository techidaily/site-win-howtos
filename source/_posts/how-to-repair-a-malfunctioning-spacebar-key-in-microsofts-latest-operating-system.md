The article shows you four methods. You may not have to try them all; just work from the top down until you find the one that works.

 **Method 2: [Install system updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Method 1: Perform a two button shutdown

 Your touch screen may stop working properly if there are corruption issues on your Surface Pro 4\. You need to perform a **two button shutdown**  to shut it down completely to see if this can clear these issues and restore your touch screen.

**2)**  Press the**volume up (+) button** and the**power button** together and**hold** them for around**15** **seconds** . (Do**NOT** release them when you see the logo pops up.)

**3)**  Leave your Surface Pro 4 for over**10** **seconds** .

**4) Start** your device. Then try your touch screen and see if it can work.  
  
## Method 2: Install system updates

 Your operating system may contain some defects that disable the touch screen of your device. You should verify that your system is updated, and install the system updates if it isn’t.
