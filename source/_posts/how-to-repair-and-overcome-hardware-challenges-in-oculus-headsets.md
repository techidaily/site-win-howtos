## Why does your wireless mouse randomly stop working?

 The reasons the wireless mouse randomly stops working can be different. But figuring out reasons is the first step to fix it. Here, I summarize the following factors that may cause your mouse problems:

* Low battery power
* Damaged mouse

* Missing or outdated drivers
* Realtek HD Audio Manager
* Disappearing cursor feature
* System files issues
* Hard errors

 You don’t need to worry too much about the above reasons but just try the methods below to fix it.

### Check the power of the wireless mouse

 When the battery is emptied, your mouse will randomly stop moving. Therefore, you have to check the power of the mouse. For battery-powered wireless mouse, you can just replace the batteries and check if it works. Or if you use a rechargeable wireless mouse, charge it and check if it works.

### Check if the wireless mouse is damaged

 As time goes, your wireless mouse is consumed. As a result, it may be damaged. Especially, a cheap mouse may have a shorter service time. When your mouse doesn’t work, you can check if your mouse has been damaged. You can connect your mouse to another PC and see if the mouse works. Once it doesn’t work, just replace it with a new one.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Method 1: Change USB port

 Your wireless mouse may come with a USB receiver. Generally, you can plug the USB receiver into a USB port on your PC and then your mouse can work. If your USB receiver is plugged into a USB port but it does not work, it may be due to the USB port. You can just try another USB port.

1. Unplug the USB receiver from your PC.
2. Plug the USB receiver into another USB port and see if it works.

### Method 2: Add a Bluetooth device

 It’s possible that your mouse works normally but it hasn’t paired with your PC. If your mouse doesn’t connect to your computer via the USB receiver, you can do it manually by adding a Bluetooth device.

1. On the keyboard, press the **Windows** logo key and **I** key at the same time to Open **Settings** .
2. Click**Devices** from the menu options.

5. You have to wait for the mouse to appear in the list and then follow the on-screen instructions to pair the device.

### Method 3: Update your wireless mouse driver

 If your operating system has updated but your mouse driver hasn’t updated, your mouse may stop working. So when your mouse does not work, you can try to update your mouse driver.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. In other words, you don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any drivers that need to update.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-04-15_15-08-24-2.jpg)
3. You can choose to update the driver with a FREE version. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.  
 Or you can click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2022-04-24_08-52-26.jpg)

 After updating your device drivers, see if your mouse problem has been solved. If not, move to the next method.

### Method 4: Disable the Realtek HD Audio Manager

 Realtek HD Audio Manager will start upon each bootup. It may interfere with the functionality of other devices and cause errors. If you disable the**Realtek HD Audio Manager** , it may help you to fix the mouse problem.

1. Press**Windows** logo and**Pause** key on keyboard at the same time.

4. After that, you can see if your mouse works.

### Method 7: Fix unknown hard errors
