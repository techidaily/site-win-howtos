## Windows 7 Won't Respond to Your Clicks? Fix Your Broken Mouse and Keyboard Connections Now

 It can be frustrating if neither mouse nor keyboard doesn’t work at the same time. If your USB mouse and keyboard stop working in Windows 7 even on the login screen, don’t worry. You can fix the issue with one of the solutions in this article.

 Before you try further solutions, **ensure the mouse and the keyboard have no problems** . If possible, try to use them on another computer. If they are working properly on another computer, it means there are no problems with the mouse and the keyboard, then you can try the solutions below. If not, you might need to replace them with the new ones.

## Try these solutions

 There are six solutions to try to fix the problem. You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down to the top of the list until you find the one that works for you.

## **Solution 6: Enable Legacy USB Support in BIOS**

 The issue would occur if Legacy USB Support is disabled in BIOS. So enter BIOS (basic input/output system ) and make sure the Legacy USB Support is enabled. The key command to enter BIOS and get to the Legacy USB port depends on the PC brand that you are using. Refer steps below to get to the Legacy USB port.

 1) Enter BIOS (See[How to Enter BIOS in Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [7](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ).

 2) In BIOS, use the specific key to navigate to**Advanced** (You can see the meaning of the key command at the bottom of the screen.).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c8d3383654c.jpg)

 3) Find Legacy USB Support or a similar USB option. If it is**Disabled** , enable it. Exit after saving the changes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58c8d4218d51d.jpg)

 Note if you don’t find  Legacy USB Support in BIOS, it is possible that the BIOS does not provide this option and this solution does not work for you. If you are still not sure how to do this, contact the PC manufacturer for further assistance.

 Hope the solutions here help you fix the mouse and keyboard not working issue in Windows 7.
