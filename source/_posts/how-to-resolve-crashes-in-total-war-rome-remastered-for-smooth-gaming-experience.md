### **Fix 1: Check if your PC meets the minimum system requirements for Nier Automata**

 Nier Automata may crash if your PC fails to meet its minimum hardware requirements. Check if your PC meets its minimum hardware requirements first:

 **The minimum system requirements for Nier Automata:**

| **Screen**    | 1270×720                      |

 As we all know, it’s never the ideal way to play Nier Automata with a PC which just meets its minimum hardware requirements. So we also list the recommended system requirements for**Nier Automata** below.

### **Fix 4: Close FAR(Fix Automata Resolution) Mod**

 Fix Automata Resolution (FAR) is developed by Nier Automata. By manipulating the graphics requirements of the game, users with lower specs can play the game. But FAR can be the reason for the Nier Automata crashing problem.

 If you have already enabled FAR mod, you can disable it and restore the game settings to default to solve the problem. Then restart your computer to check whether it solves the problem or not.

2. Type “taskmgr” and press**Enter** to open the Task Manager.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/task.jpg)
