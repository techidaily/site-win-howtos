1. [**Turn off Chrome add-ons**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Disable hardware acceleration**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Update or re-install Google Chrome**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Disable Chrome add-ons

 Add-ons are extensions to Google Chrome that allow you to do more things in your browser, or which improve your user experience. For example, the AdBlock add-on  blocks ads. Extensions are sometimes added manually and sometimes added by other programs on your computer (hopefully with your permission).

 If one of your add-ons is faulty, or for some reason conflicts with your browser or your other add-ons, it can cause the**Shockwave Flash has crashed**  issue.

 To see if this is your problem, you need to temporarily disable all your add-ons, then check if the problem is resolved. If it is, itâ€™s likely that one of your add-ons is causing the problem, and you simply need to figure out which one. Hereâ€™s how to do this:

1. Open Chrome.
2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **More tools** \> **Extensions** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b432bba1ea5a.jpg)
3. Toggle off all the extensions on your Chrome.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If yes, you can try to enable the extensions one by one until you find out the one responsible. But if it doesnâ€™t help with the situation, you might want to turn on the extensions and move on to **Fix 2** .

### Fix 2: Disable hardware acceleration

**Hardware Acceleration**  is a feature in  browsers  that tasks GPU with all the graphics and text rendering, hence giving us a better video playing and watching experience.

 But sometimes itâ€™s also the culprit of this**Shockwave Flash has crashed/not responding** issue. So we can disable the feature to see if the problem gets fixed:

1. In Chrome, in the top right corner, click on  the **three vertical dots**  button >   **Settings**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b581a513db47.jpg)
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click **Advanced** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b582452d2feb.png)
3. Scroll down to the bottom and in **System**  and **DISABLE** the toggle next to **Use hardware acceleration when available** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b581b3de44bc.jpg)
4. Re-launch Chrome and test if the video content loads without fail this time.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

This problem may occur if you are using the wrong graphics driver or itâ€™s out of date. So you should update your graphics  driver to see if it fixes your problem. If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

Driver Easy handles it all.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _ALL_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b472528c2b06.jpg)
