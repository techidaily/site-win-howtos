## Method 1: Change memory allocation  

 The “Skyrim infinite loading screen” error probably can be caused by memory shortage. So you can configure the SafetyLoad config file to set Safy Load to work while on the loading screen. The default setting allows it to run all of the time, and this can cause infinite loading screen issues or crashing issues.  

 You can follow the below steps to change the settings:  

 Before you move on, ensure you’ve installed SKSE (Skyrim Script Extender). If you don’t have installed it yet, you can install it from the[Steam SKSE page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/365720/Skyrim%5FScript%5FExtender%5FSKSE/) .  

 1) Open the file “Skyrim\\data\\SKSE\\Plugins\\**SafetyLoad.ini** ”.

 2)**Change the value** of**EnableOnlyLoading** from false to**true** .

## Method 3: Uninstall mods

 Many mods or mod conflicts can be the cause of infinite loading screen errors. If you don’t have any mods, try Method 3\. But **if you’ve installed multiple mods, you can uninstall them one by one** .  

 After uninstalling one mod, play Skyrim and see if the problem persists. If the problem is gone, it means that mod is the cause. You may not be able to use that mod. You can check the system and the device requirements for that mod, then see if your system and devices support the mod.  

**Tip** : In case a new mod causes your game not playing issues. We recommend you not install multiple mods at one time. After you install a new mod, check to see if the game can play with no problems. If there are no problems, then you can install another new mod.

## Method 4: Reinstall Skyrim  

 If the above methods don’t work for you, the last method you can try is to reinstall Skyrim. Before reinstalling Skyrim, you need to uninstall Skyrim and delete the Skyrim folders first.  

 Follow these steps:  

 1)**Uninstall Skyrim** .

 2) Delete the**\[Username\]\\Documents\\My Games\\Skyrim** folder.

 3) Delete**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steam apps\\common\\Skyrim** folder

 4)**Reboot** the computer.

 5)**Reinstall** Skyrim.

 6)**Relaunch** the game and see if the problem is resolved.
