### Fix 2: Update your Wacom driver

 When something goes wrong with your Wacom tablet, updating its driver should always be your go-to option. It’s essential that you have the latest correct driver for your device at all times.

There are two ways you can update your Wacom driver:

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#b2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 Wacom keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[Wacom support website](https://www.wacom.com/en-us)**  , find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update**  Wacom Cintiq 13HD driver
