1. Right click on the**network icon** at the bottom right corner on your desktop, and click**Open Network and Sharing Center** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f04abb90727.png) If you don’t see “**Open Network and Sharing Center** ” there, you can click**Open Network and Internet settings** , then click**Network and Sharing Center** in**Settings** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ade913312.png) ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ae1eb2cb9.jpg)
2. Click**Change adapter settings** on the left.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ae4f8eabf.jpg)
3. Right click on the**connections** that you’re not using, and select**Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9b0540f4ac.jpg)  
 You’ll need to repeat this step for any other connections that you’re not using.
4. Now your computer will only use the connection via WiFi. Restart the game and see if it works.
Still no luck? Ok, there’s one more thing to try.
