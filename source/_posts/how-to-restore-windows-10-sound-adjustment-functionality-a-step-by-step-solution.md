## Solution 1: Update your display driver

There are two ways you can update your display driver : manually or automatically. **Manual driver update –** You can update your display driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your display card  , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version. **Automatic driver update –** If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your display driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact display card, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b8cf975d05c.jpg)
3. C  lick **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b8d03cd4693.jpg)
Adjust the brightness on your Windows 10 computer to see if it works now. If it works, so great! If it doesn’t, don’t worry, move on to Solution 2.
