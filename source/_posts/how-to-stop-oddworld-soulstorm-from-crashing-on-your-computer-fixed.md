### Fix 1: Make sure your PC meets the minimum specifications for Oddworld: Soulstorm

 Oddworld: Soulstorm has a set of hardware and system requirements in order for it to be played smoothly. If your copy of Oddworld: Soulstorm crashes a lot on your PC, it’s worth checking if your PC meets the requirements.

 Below I have listed both the minimum (for playable performance) and recommended (for optimal performance) requirements for Windows PC. If you’re not sure how your system measures up against these specifications, you can follow on the steps right after to check.

| **MINIMUM** **SPECIFICATIONS** | **RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS** |                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **OPERATING SYSTEM**           | Windows 7 64 Bit               | Windows 10 64 Bit            |

| **STORAGE**                    | 20GB                           | 20GB                         |

4. Close DirectX.

 You may need to upgrade the hardware of your computer if it fails to meet the specs.

 If your PC specs are up to the mark but Oddworld: Soulstorm still crashes, please move on to**Fix 2** , below to begin troubleshooting.

### Fix 2: Update your device drivers

 This crashing error may occur if you are using the wrong or out-dated device drivers. So you should update your drivers to see if it fixes your problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/last-scan-never.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/update-your-device-drivers.png)  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
5. Launch Oddworld: Soulstorm and check to see if crashing issue has been resolved. If yes, then great! If the issue persists, please try **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: Run Epic Games Launcher as administrator

 Oddworld: Soulstorm requires administrator privileges in order to access protected system resources. If the game or the game client doesn’t have the required permissions, you may encounter crash. So you should make sure to run Epic Games Launcher as administrator to see if it fixes the issue.

Here’s how:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Windows-logo-key.png) , type**epic** , then right-click on**Epic Games Launcher** and click**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/epic.png)
2. Click**Yes** when UAC promots for permissions to proceed.

 After that, launch Oddworld: Soulstorm game and see if the crashing problem still occurs. If it doesn’t, then great! If the issue persists, please try **Fix 4** , below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4: Verify game integrity on Epic Games Launcher

 To verify the integrity of Oddworld: Soulstorm, you should first navigate to**Library** in**Epic Game Launcher** . Then locate Oddworld: Soulstorm and click on the**cog icon** in the lower-right corner and click**Verify** .

 Wait a bit until the process finishes. After that, re-launch Oddworld: Soulstorm to see if it can be played properly. If yes, then congrats! If it’s still no joy, please try**Fix 5** , below.

### Fix 5: Allow Epic Games Launcher through firewall

 A firewall is a network security system that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic by permitting/blocking specific traffic based on a set of security rules. You should allow the launcher through the firewall to make sure that the connection isn’t lost.

 To make sure you allow the app to communicate through Windows Defender Firewall:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then type **control firewall.cpl**  into the box and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/run-1.png)
2. In the window that pops up, click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Allow-an-app-or-feature-through-Windows-Defender-Firewall.png)
3. Browse through the list of Allowed apps and features to see if Epic Gamers launcher is included. If not, click **Change settings** , click **Allow another app…** , then follow the on-screen instructions to add the app.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Change-settings-Allow-another-app.png)
4. Once completed, click **OK** .
5. Run the game in the launcher and see if it still crashes. If it’s still on-going, please move on to**Fix 6** .

 If you have anti-virus software running in your computer, make sure you disable it temporarily too. During this time, be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download.

### Fix 6: Install the latest patch

 The crashing issue may be an unintended bug ensconced in the patches of the game. If this is the case, the developers would respond to this and address the issue with a new patch. So you can check out the latest patch to see if it helps fix the issue.

 If there’s no new patch available, or the problem remains after installing the latest patch, head on to**Fix 7** , below.

### Fix 7: Perform a clean boot

 Oddworld: Soulstorm may crash because of software conflict. In this case, you should perform a clean boot. A clean boot restarts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, allowing you to narrow down the programs and servicies so that you could potentially pinpoint the offender.

Here are the steps to perform a clean boot:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to bring up the Run box. Type or past **msconfig**  and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/msconfig.png)
2. Click the **Services**  tab and tick the box for **Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/service-and-hide-all-microsoft-services.png)
3. Browse through the full list of services, make sure to **check the boxes for the items that belong to your hardware manufacturers** (such as Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm) and**uncheck the boxes for the rest** . Once finished, click**OK** to apply the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/12-2.png)
4. Restart your computer, then test to see if the game still crashes.  
   * **If Oddworld: Soulstorm stops crashing** , you can try repeating these steps, disabling half of the services each time until you isolate the culpable program. Once you do, do some research on the internet to find out what the program is for, then contact the vendor of this program for advice or an alternative solution.  
   * **If Oddworld: Soulstorm still crashes** , please continue to**Fix 8** .

### Fix 8: Reinstall Oddworld: Soulstorm and the launcher

 If you’ve exhausted the options above but the issue still sticks around, then you should perhaps reinstall the game and the gamers launcher to see if you could fix the problem.
