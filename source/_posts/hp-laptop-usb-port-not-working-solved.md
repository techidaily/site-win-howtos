## Fix 2: Make sure the volume is audible

 Sometimes you can’t hear sound from your speakers simply because the volume is mute or set too low.

To make sure the volume is audible:

1. Click **the sound icon**  ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b0b6b255519f.png)  on the lower-right of your screen, then move **the volume slider**  all the way  to at least halfway up.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd7da01ab6db.jpg)  
 If there’s a volume control on the app you’re playing, make sure to slide the volume bar to an audible level too.

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then type **control** in the text field and click **OK** .

## Fix 4: Disable audio enhancements

 Audio enhancements, as the name suggests, are features that allow for highest sound fidelity from your hardware. But depending on your configuration, they can also interfere with your system and trigger sound problems. So we should disable audio enhancements to see if it fixes the no sound on laptop problem.

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then type **control** in the text field and click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-1.jpg)
2. Select **Small icons** next to View by and click **Sound** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-2.jpg)
3. In the**Playback** tab, right-click on**your default audio device** and click**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd80d9349581.jpg)
5. For some sound cards, the options may differ. So you can try to see if there’s an **Advanced** tab, where you can untick the box for **Enable audio enhancements** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sound-enhancement.png)
6. Test your audio device and see if the no sound issue is resolved. If yes, then congrats! But if the issue remains, you should try**Fix 5** , below.
