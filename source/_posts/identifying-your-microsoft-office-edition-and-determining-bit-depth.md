 Many of us use Microsoft Office programs daily, but you may forget which version of Office you’re running. If you need to know which edition of Office you have, as well as which architecture (32-bit or 64-bit), we’ll show you how to quickly find this information on Windows and Mac.

 Knowing which version of Office you have can be useful if you are [downloading templates](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/best-ways-on-how-to-unlockbypassswiperemove-infinix-note-30-5g-fingerprint-lock-by-drfone-android/) and [Office add-ins](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/sovol-sv08-evaluation-reviving-the-spirit-of-voron-on-two-wheels/), some of which only work with specific versions of Office.

##  Windows: Office 2013 and 2016

 Open one of the programs in Office, such as Word. If the ribbon looks similar to the following image (ribbon tabs with sharp corners), you are using either Office 2013 or 2016\. If your ribbon looks different, skip to the next section.

 To find out more details about which version of Office 2013 or 2016 you are using, click the “File” tab.

 On the right side of the Account screen, you’ll see which edition of Office you’re using and whether or not you have a subscription product. Under Office Updates, the exact version number and build number are listed. To find out whether your version of Office is 32-bit or 64-bit, click “About Word”.

 On the Mac, there is no choice between running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of the operating system, since the OS has been 64-bit for several years. Office for Mac 2011 was only available in a 32-bit version, and Office for Mac 2016 is now only available in a 64-bit version.
