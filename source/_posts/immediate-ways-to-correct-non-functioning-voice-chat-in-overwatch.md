### Fix 2: Set default devices

 Ideally Windows can automatically detect your device and set it as the default playback device every time itâ€™s plugged into. But thatâ€™s not always the case and sometimes weâ€™ll have to set default devices (both output device and input device) manually to see if it fixes your**Overwatch voice chat not working** issue.  

Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Exit Overwatch.
2. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type **mmsys.cpl** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c04ca9f1b8b4.png)
3. In the **Playback**  tab, right-click on**the speakers/headphones youâ€™re to use in Overwatch** and  click **Set Default** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c04d27e6fe9c.jpg)
4. While still in the**Playback** tab, right-click and click**Disable** on **EVERY OTHER** device**EXCEPT** the default device.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c04d3d257d41.jpg)
5. Click the  **Recording**  tab, then right-click on   **the speakers/headphones youâ€™re to use in Overwatch**  and click  **Set as Default device**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c04d384b07c3.jpg)
6. While still in the**Recording** tab, right-click and click**Disable** on **EVERY OTHER** device **EXCEPT**  the default device.

### Fix 3: Disable Exclusive Mode

 Third party apps can prevent Blizzard games from accessing your microphone, speakers, or headset. Disabling Exclusive Mode of your hardware may fix sound or voice-chat not working issues.

Hereâ€™s how:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type **mmsys.cpl** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c04ca9f1b8b4.png)
2. In the**Playback** tab, right-click on**your default device** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c04cc544ea24.jpg)
3. Click the **Advanced**  tab and un-check**the box** before **Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device** . Then click **Apply**  \> **OK**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c04cd0648d4d.jpg)
4. Check the voice chat in Overwatch and hopefully the problem has been fixed.

### Fix 4: Check your in-game audio settings

 If the fixes above didnâ€™t help, then you might want to adjust your in-game audio settings to see if it works. To do so:

1. In Overwatch, click**Options** \>**Sound** .
2. Turn up both**microphone** or**speakers** sound to an audible level.
3. Make sure**GROUP VOICE CHAT** and**TEAM VOICE CHAT** are set to**AUTO JOIN, the right device selected** for**VOICE CHAT DEVICES** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c04c7f097042.jpg)  
 If your voice chat is set to**Push To Talk** , try changing the keybind for Voice Chat:**Push To Talk** to a different key in the Controls menu.
