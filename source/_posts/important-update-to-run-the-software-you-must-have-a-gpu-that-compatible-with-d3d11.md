 All the fixes below work in**Windows 10** ,**8** and**7** . You may not have to try all of them; just work your way down the list until the problem is resolved.

1. [**Turn off Chrome add-ons**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Disable hardware acceleration**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Update or re-install Google Chrome**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Disable Chrome add-ons

 Add-ons are extensions to Google Chrome that allow you to do more things in your browser, or which improve your user experience. For example, the AdBlock add-on  blocks ads. Extensions are sometimes added manually and sometimes added by other programs on your computer (hopefully with your permission).

 If one of your add-ons is faulty, or for some reason conflicts with your browser or your other add-ons, it can cause the**Shockwave Flash has crashed**  issue.

 To see if this is your problem, you need to temporarily disable all your add-ons, then check if the problem is resolved. If it is, it’s likely that one of your add-ons is causing the problem, and you simply need to figure out which one. Here’s how to do this:

1. Open Chrome.
2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **More tools** \> **Extensions** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b432bba1ea5a.jpg)
3. Toggle off all the extensions on your Chrome.

4. Re-launch Chrome, play the same content and see if it works smoothly.

 If yes, you can try to enable the extensions one by one until you find out the one responsible. But if it doesn’t help with the situation, you might want to turn on the extensions and move on to **Fix 2** .

### Fix 2: Disable hardware acceleration

**Hardware Acceleration**  is a feature in  browsers  that tasks GPU with all the graphics and text rendering, hence giving us a better video playing and watching experience.

 But sometimes it’s also the culprit of this**Shockwave Flash has crashed/not responding** issue. So we can disable the feature to see if the problem gets fixed:

1. In Chrome, in the top right corner, click on  the **three vertical dots**  button >   **Settings**  .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b581a513db47.jpg)
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click **Advanced** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b582452d2feb.png)
3. Scroll down to the bottom and in **System**  and **DISABLE** the toggle next to **Use hardware acceleration when available** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b581b3de44bc.jpg)
4. Re-launch Chrome and test if the video content loads without fail this time.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

This problem may occur if you are using the wrong graphics driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your graphics  driver to see if it fixes your problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the**Pro version** it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _ALL_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b472528c2b06.jpg)  

 You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your computer, then keep track of your Chrome to see if everything runs smoothly.

To do so:

1. Open Chrome.
2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **help** \> **About Google Chrome** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b433a86ba999.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

* If yes, follow the on-screen instruction to finish the update.
