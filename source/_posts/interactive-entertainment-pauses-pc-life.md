1. Type “control panel” in the search box and press **Enter** .
2. Set the Control Panel view by **Large icons** and click **Power Options** .

## Method 3: Prevent overheating

 If your PC is overheating, you’ll meet a reboot problem while playing a game. Because when the CPU gets too busy it causes high energy and produces heat, your PC will shut down automatically to protect itself. Therefore, to prevent this situation from happening, you have to clean your PC. Clean the dust in your PC and check all the fans are working properly.

 Also, you can use free tools like [HWMonitor](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html) or [AIDA64](https://www.aida64.com/downloads) to tell whether your computer CPU, the CPU core, and the GPU are running too hot.
