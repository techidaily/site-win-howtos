## Keyboard Not Working? Here's How You Can Fix It on Windows 11, 7, or 8

It is very inconvenient if none key on your keyboard works. Keyboard not typing issue can be caused by many reasons. To fix the issue, you can try methods below. After that, your keyboard should work properly again.

---

### **Method 1: Try the keyboard on another computer**

 If the keyboard is broken, this issue would occur. If possible, use the keyboard on another computer. If it doesn’t work on another computer, the issue is caused by the keyboard. You might need to replace it with a new keyboard.

---

### **Method 2: Check if the keyboard is connected correctly**

 The error may be caused by a loose connection, so you can try checking the connection.  
 If you are using a USB keyboard, try unplugging it then plugging it back in.
 If you are using a wireless keyboard, try troubleshooting the wireless connection.

### **Method 3: Plug the keyboard to another USB port** (for USB keyboard only)

 The USB port that you are using may be having problem. Try plugging the keyboard to another USB port and see if the error persists.

---

#### **Method 4: Check keyboard batteries and wireless adapters** (for wireless keyboard only)

 If you are using a wireless keyboard, check and see if the batteries are down. Check if the keyboard is close enough to the wireless receiver. You need to make sure the keyboard is within 30 centimeters (1 foot) of the receiver. And make sure the wireless receiver is not being blocked.

**IMPORTANT** : Following methods need you to perform on Windows. Since the keyboard is not working, use a mouse to do the fixes.

---

### **Method 5: Update Drivers**

 The issue can be caused by faulty keyboard or wireless drivers. You can try updating the drivers.  

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
