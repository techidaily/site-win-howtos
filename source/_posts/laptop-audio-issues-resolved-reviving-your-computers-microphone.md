## Fix 1: Update your device drivers

If you got the mic-not-working issue after having Windows Updates, it’s possible that the drivers (especially the sound card driver) you’re using currently are out-dated, missing, or incompatible with your system. In case you’re not sure whether all the drivers are working fine, you should check.

 You can do this in Windows Device Manager, one device at a time. But this takes a lot of time and patience, and if any of your drivers do happen to be out of date, you’ll need to manually update them, which is difficult and risky. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually,   **you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just two clicks (and you’ll get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update** button next to all flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their driver, then you can manually install the driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

**Note:** If you have any problems using**Driver Easy Pro** to update your driver, please feel free to email us at **<support@drivereasy.com>** . We are always here to help.

## Fix 2: Set microphone as default device

 Chances are your mic has not been set as the default device, so the sound won’t be played through it. To set your mic as default, you should perform the following procedure:

 1) Click the speaker icon ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2020-05-18_15-02-50.jpg) in the notification area of your taskbar. Then click **Open Volume mixer** .

 3) Go to the **Recording** tab, right-click an empty area inside the devices’ display list, and then tick **Show Disabled Devices** to ensure that your mic device shows up.

 4) Click to highlight your microphone, then click**Set Default > Default Device** .

**Note:** Your mic device may not be listed as “Microphone” and the icon thereof may not even resemble a microphone. You should be able to recognize it yourself.

 You can also right-click the mic item and check if it is disabled. If it is, select **Enable** to get your mic working.

 5) Again, click to highlight your mic. This time, click**Properties** .
