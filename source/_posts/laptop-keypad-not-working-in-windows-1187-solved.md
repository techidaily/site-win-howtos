## Fix 1: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 Before we make any changes, we might have to troubleshoot hardware issues. To do so:

1. Make sure to check your speaker and headphone connections for loose cables or the wrong jack.
2. Try connecting your speaker or headphone device to a different port and see if this fixes the problem.

 If the no sound on the ASUS laptop problem still persists, then move on to**Fix 2** , below.

## Fix 2: Make sure the volume is audible

 Sometimes you can’t hear sound from your speakers simply because the volume is mute or set too low.

To make sure the volume is audible:

1. Click **the sound icon**  ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b0b6b255519f.png)  on the lower-right of your screen, then move **the volume slider**  all the way  to at least halfway up.

## Fix 3: Set default audio devices

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then type **control** in the text field and click **OK** .
