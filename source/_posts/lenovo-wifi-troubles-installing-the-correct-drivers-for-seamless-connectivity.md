 1) Right-click on the shortcut and select**Run as Administrator** .

![Windows Defender Firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/windows-firewall-1.jpg)

![allow an app through windows defender firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/allow-an-app-through-windows-defender-firewall-1.jpg)

 3) Click **Change settings** if it’s enabled on your end. Then click **Allow another app** .  
  
![allow VALORANT through windows firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/allow-another-app-1.jpg)

 Then you can follow the on-screen instructions to add Steam to the list. By default, the location of the main Steam executable is**C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\bin** .

 If you have other anti-virus software running, make sure you disable them temporarily.
