Local Security Authority Protection is off

 No need to worry if your Local Security Authority Protection is toggled off: in most cases, it was a UI bug with a certain Windows update patch, meaning that it’s not off, just appears to be off, and you can install another update patch to get it fixed. In other rare cases, you can change your computer settings to get it enabled again. Read on and see how you can fix the Local Security Authority Protection being off problem.

## 2\. Modify Registry Editor

 If you’re still seeing the Local Security Authority protection off message even when you’ve turned it ON, please do the following to modify your Registry Editor:

 Incorrectly modifying Registry Editor files could cause severe computer problems, so please make sure that you always create a backup or a restore point for your computer first before you change anything in the Registry Editor.

1. Firstly, create a system restore point as instructed here:[How to enable and create restore points in Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (the screenshots here are from Windows 10, but the instructions work on Windows 11 as well).
2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key together. Type**regedit** and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-27.png)
3. Go to the following location:`**Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa**`  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-26.png)
4. On the right side, if you can see **RunAsPPL** , double-click it and change the**Value data** to**2** . Repeat the same with**RunAsPPLBoot** . If you don’t see either of these entries, move on to the next step.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-29.png)

Name the new entry**RunAsPPL** , then double-click it to change its**Value data** to**2** . Repeat the same to create a new entry named**RunAsPPLBoot** and change its value data to 2.
