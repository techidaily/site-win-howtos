### Fix 2: Turn off Chrome add-ons

 Add-ons are extensions to Chrome that allow you to do more things in your browser, or which improve your  user experience. For example, the AdBlock add-on blocks ads. Extensions are sometimes added manually and sometimes added by other programs on your computer (hopefully with your permission).

 If you have too many add-ons, they can may overload your browser and cause the **Google Chrome not responding**  issue.

1. Open Chrome.
2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **More tools** \> **Extensions** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901410&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg" border="0"> vMix Pro - Software based live production. vMix Pro includes everything in vMix 4K plus 8 channels of Replay and 8 vMix Call

4. **Restart**  your computer and check if**Google Chrome**  now works:

* If Google Chrome does respond after disabling all your add-ons, it’s likely one of your add-ons was the problem. Now you just need to figure out which one. To do this, enable the first add-on in the list, then see if Google Chrome still works. If it doesn’t, then you’ve found the cause of the problem. If Google Chrome works fine after enabling the first add-on, enable the second and test again. Continue testing each add-on in this way until you find the one that stops Internet Explorer from working. Once you find it, disable it again. If you need it, contact the vendor for support.
* If disabling your add-ons doesn’t solve the **Chrome not responding**  issue, please try **Fix 3** , below.

 Updating Chrome will not touch any of your browser settings or data, and is considered as a safe option in most cases.

To do so:

1. Open Chrome.
2. In the top right, click on **the three vertical dots** button > **help** \>**About Google Chrome** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1922358/21553" target="_top" id="1922358"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1922358" border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1922358/21553" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

3. Google Chrome automatically detects if there’s an update available:  
   * If yes, follow the on-screen instruction to finish the update.  
   * If no, delete Chrome and re-install it on Windows store or other trustworthy third-party website. (**NOTE** : This will erase your Chrome browser settings and data)
4. Check if the**Google** **Chrome not responding** issue has been resolved.
