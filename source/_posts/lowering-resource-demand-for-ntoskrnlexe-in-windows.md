### Fix 5: Update your Bluetooth driver

 One of the most common causes of this problem is an outdated or faulty Bluetooth driver. If you never bother to, or don’t remember when was the last time you updated your Bluetooth driver, definitely do it now. It might just fix your problem right away.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your Bluetooth driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your Bluetooth driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can try to update the Bluetooth driver manually.

 To do so, first visit the website of your device manufacturer, then search for your device model. Be sure to download only the latest driver that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to proceed.

#### Option 2:Update your Bluetooth driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Bluetooth driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
