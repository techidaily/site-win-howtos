## Fix 1: Temporarily disable your antivirus program

 If antivirus program is running in your computer, it may stop your software from running properly, and popping up errors like this fatal error code, which is a common case for many other programs. In these circumstances, you can temporarily disable antivirus program in your computer, then play your game to see how it works.

**Note** : be extra careful with the websites you visit and popups while your antivirus program is disabled.

 If Black Ops 4 stops popping up the error after your disabling antivirus program, then you should find the culprit. And you should add your game to the exception of your antivirus program, or head to the vendor for further advice.

 If your problem still persists, don’t worry. Re-enable antivirus program and move on to the next method.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics card driver

 A missing or corrupted graphics card driver can lead to the fatal error, so you should verify that your graphics card driver is up to date.

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can head to the website of your graphics manufacturer, download and install the latest version for your Windows variant (in my case it’s Windows 10 64 bit). This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to manually update your driver, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged video card and to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install it in your computer.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click_Update All_ and get a 30-day money guarantee).

## Fix 5: Avoid software conflicts

 If you recently installed software in your computer, be carefully with what have been installed, because that may cause software conflicts and your mouse cursor will flicker.

 In addition to the recently-installed programs, you should also keep an eye on other programs running when you’re playing Black Ops 4, such as the**Razer software** , these can cause software conflicts and so you see the fatal errors from within the game.

1) Close your game and other programs running in your computer.

2) On your keyboard, press the**Ctrl** key,**Shift** key, and**Esc** key at the same time to invoke Task Manager.

3) End the tasks that don’t relate to your game, especially the**Razer software** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-84.png)

4) Relaunch Call of Duty Black Ops 4 and see how it works.

 If the fatal errors stop occurring, then you should find the culprit. So you can uninstall those programs that cause conflicts.

## Fix 6: Reinstall your game

 If the methods above didn’t help with your problem, you can reinstall Call of Duty Black Ops 4 to resolve the fatal errors.

Reinstall Call of Duty Black Ops 4 in Battle.net:

 1) Open the**Blizzard Battle.net app** in your computer.

 2) Find**Call of Duty Black Ops 4** , and right click on the icon of your game, and select**Options** .
