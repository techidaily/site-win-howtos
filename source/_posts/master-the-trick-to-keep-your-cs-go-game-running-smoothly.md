### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 This problem may occur if you’re using a wrong or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes the issue. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either[**Free**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 2: Stop overclocking your GPU

 Overlocking the GPU is a good method to try if you wish for a faster and smoother game performance. But pushing it too high may cause the game crashing issue.

 If you ever overlocked you GPU and encounter the CS:GO crashing issue,  
 you can try lowering it back to the default setting. If not, or it doesn’t help with the situation, you should try **Fix 3** .

---

### Fix 3: Verify integrity of game files

 You may have this**CSGO crashing** issue if some files of your game installation are corrupt or have been deleted as a false positive by antivirus programs. So you can verify the integrity of game files to see if it fixes the issue.

To do so:

 1) In Steam, go to**LIBRARY** .

 2) In your list of games, locate and right-click on **Counter -Strike: Global Offensive** in your list of games and click **Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-180.png)

 3) Click**LOCAL FILES** \>**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES..** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-177.png)

4) Wait until the game cache verification finishes.

5) Close the windows in Steam and exit Steam.

6) Relaunch Steam, then run CS:GO and see if the **CSGO crashing** problem has been fixed. If the crashing problem still occurs, move on to**Fix 4** , below.

### Fix 4: Launch CSGO in -autoconfig or -safe mode

 You can also try running CSGO in a different mode to see if the crashing issue disappears. Here we recommend the**\-autoconfig** mode and the**\-safe** mode.

 You can use only ONE of these launch options at a time. Once the game crashing issues have been resolved, you’ll need to remove these modes.
