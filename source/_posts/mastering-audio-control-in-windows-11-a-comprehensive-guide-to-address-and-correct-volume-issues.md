### Why does 0xc00000e9 occur to my computer?

The error code 0xc00000e9 is generally a hardware error pretaining to your**BIOS settings**. If you are seeing this error, generally it’s because your computer can’t communicate with the hard drive. Another cause is the**SSD (Solid-state drive) issue**when installing Windows.

If you get the error again after connecting certain device, you can identify the issue now. You can either replace this device completely from your PC, or update its driver as instructed in[solution 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/).

## **Solution 2: Change your BIOS settings**

## **Solution 3: Update your drivers**

The driver problem can also cause the error 0xc00000e9, because the hardware can’t communicate with the software if there’s something wrong with drivers. You should **verify that all your devices have the right and latest drivers and update those that don’t**.

**Note** : Before updating drivers, you should boot your computer in**Safe Mode with Network** . (You can check this article for more information about **[how to enter Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .)

**Manual driver update**– You can update your drivers manually by going to the**manufacturer’s website**and searching for the**most recent correct driver**. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .**Automatic driver update**– Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE**or the**Pro**version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee**): 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** and install Driver Easy. 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now**button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/img_5aaf6cdfc84d7.png)3) Click the**Update**button next to all flagged devices to automatically download and install the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE**version). Or click**Update All**to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All**).

## **Solution 5: Fix the MBR with Windows PE**

**Note** : This is a complicated and difficult process. You should attempt it only if you’re confident in your computer skills.

1) Connect the**hard drive**or**external drive**with the**Windows PE**to your computer. 2) Launch Windows PE, and**set your C drive as your Master Boot Record**. 3)**Reboot**your computer to reinstall Windows to see if the problem is solved.
