 If you use Microsoft Excel for financial data where exchange rates are part of what you need, check out the Currencies [data type](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-sign-up-process-for-using-google-meet/). This gives you various exchange details that you can include in your spreadsheet.

 You can obtain the last trade time, high and low, change percent, and more by entering a pair of [ISO currency codes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isocurrencycode.asp). Then, simply select the details you want to include and refresh the data as needed.

 As of May 2022, the feature is only available to [Microsoft 365](https://games-able.techidaily.com/ultimate-console-content-psplus-or-xbox-game-pass/) subscribers. You can use the feature in Excel for Microsoft 365 on Windows and Mac as well as Excel for the web.

##  Enter the Currency Pairs

 You'll enter a pair of [currencies](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-vivo-v30-phone-pattern-lock-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/) using the ISO codes as:

        `From Currency / To Currency`
    
 . You can use a colon instead of a slash if you prefer, but Excel will convert it to a slash when you apply the data type.

 So, to obtain the exchange rate and details from U.S. dollars to Euros, you would enter:

        `USD/EUR`
    
 . Or, for Australian dollars to U.S. dollars you would enter:

        `AUD/USD`
    
 .

 Once you add the pair(s) you want to use, you'll apply the data type and select the details to display.

##  Apply the Currencies Data Type

 Select the cell where you entered the currency pair. Go to the Data tab and choose "Currencies" in the Data Types box.

 If you see a question mark instead of the Currencies data type icon, that means Excel is having trouble matching the data you entered. Double-check the ISO codes for the currency types or click the question mark for more help.
