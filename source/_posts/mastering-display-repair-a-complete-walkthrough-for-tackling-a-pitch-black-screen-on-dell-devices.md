### Fix 2: Insert a **Miracast adapter**

It’s also possible that the device you’re streaming content to doesn’t support Miracast. But don’t worry – if that’s the case, you need to do to enable Miracast is to plug in a Miracast adapter, such as a[Microsoft Wireless Display adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Wireless-Display-Adapter-P3Q-00001/dp/B01AZC3J3M/ref=sr%5F1%5F1%5Fsspa?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1542013017&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=Microsoft+Wireless+Display+Adapter&psc=1&tag=drivereasycom-20), into an HDMI port on your display device.
