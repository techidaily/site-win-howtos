### Fix 1: Update your video card drivers

 Keep in mind to update your video card drivers at regular times; otherwise an out-dated or corrupt driver may end up lowering your FPS and even preventing the game from running smoothly.

 Besides, if it turns out that merely updating the video drivers cannot solve your issue, you should take a shot at updating every possible device driver (such as CPU and audio) and see whether that works for you.

 No need to worry if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update drivers manually – **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is there for you.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy takes care of everything.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE**  or the **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** ). Or if you just want to update your video card driver, simply click the**Update** button next to it.

**Note:** you can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 Now launch the game and check whether it runs smoothly. Hopefully it does; but if not, read on and try out the next fix below.

### Fix 3: Adjust in-game settings

 This is also a quick-fix when you find yourself suffering from a lag issue in Fallout 4 – adjust the in-game settings.

 1) Launch Fallout 4\. Then, on the launch menu, click**Options** .

 2) Set**Resolutions** to the same value as your monitor uses. After that, make sure you check these two boxes:**Windowed Mode** and**Borderless** . Click**OK** to save the changes.

 If you’re not sure about the exact resolution of your monitor, you can right-click an empty area on your desktop and select**Display settings** from the context menu. In the pop-up window, take note of the recommended option under**Resolution** , the one that best suits your monitor size.

 Run the game to see if it goes smoothly this time. If not, move on and check out the next fix.

### Fix 4: Uncap FPS limit

 You may seek to uncap the FPS limit of Fallout 4 by using Notepad to modify some certain values. Here’s how to do it:

 1) Navigate to the following folder (this is where the game file basically resides):

C:\Users\YourWindowsName\Documents\My Games\Fallout4

 2) Locate a file named**Fallout4Prefs.ini** . Right-click on it to open the context menu and then click**Open with** \> **Notepad** .

 3) After the file is opened, press**Ctrl + F** on your keyboard to invoke the**Find** dialog box. Then, type in**iPresentInterval** and hit**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-217.png)

 When you find out the line, change**iPresentInterval=1** to**iPresentInterval=0** .

4) Save the file and exit Notepad.

**Note:** According to some players, uncapping FPS limit may bring about messy side effects such as “UI is boosted up” (thanks to the comment by**one russian лёха** ). If you run into problems like that, please revert the change. Just reset**iPresentInterval** to**1** , exit the game and then relaunch it.

 If this fix doesn’t work for you, you may read on and try the next one.

### Fix 5: Stop CPU/memory hogging applications

 If you have too many CPU/memory hogging applications running in the background, that may slow down the processing speed of your computer and lead to low FPS in Fallout 4\. Thus, you need to close these applications before you start to play the game. Here are the steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type in **taskmgr** and hit **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-296.png)

 2) Select the**Processes** tab. Right-click on the CPU/memory hogging process such as Google Chrome to open its context menu. Then click **End task** .

 Do not close the processes that you’re not familiar with in case you mistakenly stop the important ones.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-13_10-51-43.png)

 3) Disable your antivirus software temporarily. This is optional to you but you can give it a try and see if that mitigates your problem.

**Note** that Microsoft has its own default anti-malware, **Windows Defender** . It’s automatically enabled even if you also have other antivirus applications installed. Even if you disable the third-party antivirus programs, Windows Defender is still there for you during that certain time range. So, no need to worry too much about temporarily turning your antivirus off.
