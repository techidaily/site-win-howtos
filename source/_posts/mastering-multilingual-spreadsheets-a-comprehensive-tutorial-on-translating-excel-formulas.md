##  Install the Functions Translator Add-In

 The Functions Translator is a [Microsoft add-in](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/sovol-sv08-evaluation-reviving-the-spirit-of-voron-on-two-wheels/) available for free. You can install it by heading to the Insert tab and choosing "Get Add-ins" in the Add-ins section of the ribbon.

 Select Get Started to head to the language settings. If you prefer to get right to work, you can choose "Skip" on the top right.

 This sends you directly to the Reference tab in the tool's sidebar. Use the drop-down box at the top to pick a category for the function or use "All" to see them all.

 The functions [appear in alphabetical order](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/asian-miniature-villages-in-creative-sphere-of-mc-for-2024/) so you can find the one you need easily. You'll see the languages at the top of the list with From on the left and To on the right.

![Browse functions on the Reference tab](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Reference-ExcelFunctionsTranslator.png) 

 For additional information about a function, select it. You'll then see a description of the function on the Dictionary tab.

![Get function descriptions on the Dictionary tab](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Dictionary-ExcelFunctionsTranslator.png) 

 You can also use the Dictionary tab on its own to search for any function you like and see the description and corresponding function in another language.
