 2\. Type **bcdedit /set GUID recoveryenabled No** and hit**Enter** . Replace GUID with the number that you noted in last step. (For example, if the number is 7ce0dd34-d277-11e4-8263-68f7286346fb, the full command will be “bcdedit /set 7ce0dd34-d277-11e4-8263-68f7286346fb recoveryenabled No”)  
  
 3\. Reboot your PC and Windows should start without no problem.

 **Solution 3: Remove Your RAM**
  
 The loop error can be fixed by simply removing the RAM. You can try this solution. Before removing, remember to turn off the PC.If you have more than one RAM, remove one at a time then start your PC without it. You might need to do this a few times until you test every RAM module.

 After entering Windows, run a disk check to check if there is any problem with the disk, and run a system file check to check if some system files are corrupted. If neither of them work, try to restore Windows registry.  
  
**Run a disk check**
  
 Follow steps below:  
  
 1\. Open[**Command Prompt**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) as an administrator.
  
 2\. Type**chkdsk /f /r** and hit**Enter** . You need to wait a while until the process completes.
