### **Fix 3: Update or reinstall your drivers**

#### A. Update your driver

 Missing or outdated drivers may also trigger the game crash issues. In this case, you need to update your drivers to resolve this issue.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**automatically** and**manually** .

**Option 1–Automatically**

 Use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to automatically update your driver with 2 clicks (  
 This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ) :  

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/gpu1-3.jpg)

You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  
 Or you can click the**Update** button next to the graphics card driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/gpu-3.jpg)

### **Fix 4: Close FAR(Fix Automata Resolution) Mod**

 Fix Automata Resolution (FAR) is developed by Nier Automata. By manipulating the graphics requirements of the game, users with lower specs can play the game. But FAR can be the reason for the Nier Automata crashing problem.

 If you have already enabled FAR mod, you can disable it and restore the game settings to default to solve the problem. Then restart your computer to check whether it solves the problem or not.

### Fix 5: Change processor affinity

 According to practice and some users experiences, processor affinity can help users get rid of the crash. You can try this method, but if it works for you, you have to repeat it every time when you launch the game.

1. Run the game, then press the**Windows logo key** +**R** together to open the run box.
2. Type “taskmgr” and press**Enter** to open the Task Manager.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/task.jpg)
3. Choose**Details** . Find Nier Automata.exe, right-click on it and click**Set affinity** .
