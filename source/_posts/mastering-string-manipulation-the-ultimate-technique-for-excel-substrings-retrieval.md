##  Get the String To the Left of Your Text

 If you'd like to get all the text that's to the left of the specified character in your cell, use Excel's

        `LEFT`
    
 and `FIND` functions to do that.

 First, open your spreadsheet and click the cell in which you want to see the result.

![Select a cell.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-left-select-cell.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 In your selected cell, type the following function. In this function, replace `B2` with the cell where your full text is and `@` with the search character. The function will retrieve the entire string to the left of this character.

 Then press Enter.

=LEFT(B2,FIND("@",B2)-1)

![Use the LEFT function.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-enter-left-function.png) 

 Your selected cell will display the result of the function, which is the full text before your specified character in your cell.

##  Obtain a String From the Middle of Your Text

 If you'd like to extract a string containing a specific number of characters located at a certain position in your cell, use Excel's `MID` function.

 In your spreadsheet, select the cell where you want to display the resulting string.

![Click a cell.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/7-mid-select-cell.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 In the selected cell, enter the following function. In this function, replace `B2` with the cell where you have the full text, `1` with the position of the character where you want to start the string selection, and `3` with the number of characters you want to extract.

 Then press Enter.

=MID(B2,1,3)
