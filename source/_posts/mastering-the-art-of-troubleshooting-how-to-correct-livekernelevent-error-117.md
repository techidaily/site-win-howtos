### Fix 2: Log on Zombie first

 If reboot your device and game don’t help, you can try logging into Zombies. This sounds wired, but it seems the Zombies mode is different from the others in connecting mechanisms. This mysterious fix works for many users and you could have a try.

1. Launch COD WW2.
2. Connect to Xbox Live. You may receive the error code but don’t worry, click**NAZI ZOMBIES** .
3. Click**MULTIPLAYER** . You’ll back to the main menu.
4. Select Xbox live.

You should be able to play multiplayer mode.

### Fix 3: Check the connection

 You can only play COD: WW 2 with stable and constant internet. So check your connection from the console and try reconnecting to Xbox live. This bug could be related to the internet connection.

Use a wired connection if you’re a PC player.

* You need to make sure you’ve signed into your system account. If there’s a problem when signing into your account, it’s probably you have connection issues.

**Troubleshooting on** [**Xbox One**](https://beta.support.xbox.com/help/Hardware-Network/connect-network/network-settings#83dc7f0c62b1417fb8f85ef45393a1f1) **/** [**PS4**](https://support.playstation.com/s/article/Troubleshoot-Wired-or-Wireless-Network-Connection?language=en%5FUS) **/** [**Steam**](https://support.steampowered.com/kb%5Farticle.php?ref=1456-EUDN-2493) **.**

* If you were signed in but couldn’t connect, you need to check the connectivity alerts on your system’s status page.  
 PS4/Xbox one players are suggested to test your connection to find the culprit.

**Test connection** **For PS4 player**

1. From the PlayStation home screen, select **Settings** .
2. Select **Network** .
3. Select **Test Internet Connection** and allow the test to run.

**Test connection** **For Xbox one player**

2. Go to **Settings** and select **Network** .
3. In the right-hand column, select **Test network connection** , and allow the test to run.

### Fix 4: Reinstall the game

 Uninstall the game and reinstall it could simply rewrite data files. The error code may be fixed by this fix.

1. Press**the Windows logo key and R** on your keyboard at the same time to invoke the Run box.

## Update your driver

 It is very important to update your drivers, especially for gamers. To geta a better gaming experience, your device driver should be upgraded to the latest version. This can prevent your computer from potential problems.

 You may say Windows updates could help you do the job, but Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version and sometimes it won’t tell you your device drivers need to be updated.

 So **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  comes to help.

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
