##  Solution 4: Update the toupad driver  

 The steps above may resolve the problem, but it they donâ€™t, update the touchpad driver.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your touchpad: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** â€“ You can update your touchpad driver manually by going to the manufacturerâ€™s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver for each. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** â€“ If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your touchpad driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your touchpad, and your variant of Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a6beb3248b3b.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged touchpad driver to automatically download and install the correct version of that driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **Pro** version which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. Youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 4) Restart your computer and check to see if the problem is resolved.  
  
 Thatâ€™s all there is to it. Hopefully one of these methods resolves your problem, and you can now use your two finger scroll.
