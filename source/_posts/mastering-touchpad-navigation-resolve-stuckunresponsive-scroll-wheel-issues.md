 The steps above may resolve the problem, but it they don’t, update the touchpad driver.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your touchpad: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your touchpad driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver for each. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your touchpad driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your touchpad, and your variant of Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged touchpad driver to automatically download and install the correct version of that driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **Pro** version which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
