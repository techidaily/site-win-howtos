## 1\. Repair your game

 Missing or corrupt game files can cause a wide variety of issues. So you need to make sure they are intact. The feature, repairing games allows you to achieve that goal. It checks your game’s installation and then automatically downloads any replacement or missing files:

1) Open Origin.

2) Select**My Game Library** . Right-click on your game title and select**Repair** .  
  
![Origin error There is a problem with your game's setup. Please reinstall your game. ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/repair-game.jpg)

 This file check can take up to an hour to complete depending on your computer’s hardware. If there are any file issues or corrupt files, it will replace them or download them again.

If that didn’t help, try the next fix below.

## 2\. Clear Origin game cache

 To be able to load faster, Origin stores data called cache files. But over time, these files accumulate out-of-date data and because of this, it’s best to delete them, especially if you’re having problems with your games. Here’s how to do this:

 1) Make sure Origin is fully closed. You need to first close the app and then check if**Origin.exe, OriginClientService, and OriginWebHelperService** are still running in the background by following these steps:

* On your keyboard, press the**Windows + R keys** simultaneously to invoke the Run box.
* Type or paste**taskmgr** and press Enter.  

![open task manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/open-task-manager.jpg)

* Under the**Processes** tab, look for**Origin, OriginClientService, and OriginWebHelperService** . If they’re on the list, make sure to right-click each and then select**End task** .

## 3\. Update your device drivers

 A driver is an essential piece of software that lets your system communicate with your hardware. If the device drivers are outdated, it would cause noticeable performance problems. When there are error messages popping up while launching a program, you should consider if you’re using any outdated drivers.

 But you may doubt if updating drivers can make any difference. The answer is yes. Driver updates can give you a speed boost, fix problems, and sometimes even provide you with completely new features. So why not attempt to check for drivers updates and check how it works.

 To update your device drivers, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or head to the manufacturer’s driver download page to download and install the exact drivers for your system. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

## 4\. Run Origin as an administrator

 There are some situations that your game can’t be installed because your Origin client lacks the administrative privileges. Therefore, you may need to run Origin as an administrator:

1) Close your Origin client.

2) Right-click the Origin client icon on your desktop (or in the Origin directory if not on your desktop and click**Run As Administrator** .  
  
![Run Origin as an administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/run-as-administrator.jpg)

If you want to make Origin always run as administrator, take these steps:

* Right-click the Origin client icon on your desktop (or in the Origin directory if not on your desktop and click**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![always run Origin as an administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/always-run-Origin-as-an-administrator.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![always run Origin as an administrator](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/run-Origin-as-administrator.jpg)

 Resume your installation and check if it helped you fix the issue. If your problem persists, try the next fix below.

## 5\. Install the latest visual C++ redistributable pack

 Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is a standard distributable package of shared code that comes as part of your Windows and enables apps to run on your PC. If it’s missing or your current one is out-of-date, some apps that rely on the redistributable will fail to start or run and it will result in a total mess. Therefore, we would suggest you install the latest Visual C++ from[Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0) , both the x64 and x86 versions (you’ll find them in the**Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019** section. )

If that didn’t help, move on to the next fix.

## 6\. Download Media Feature Pack for Windows 10 N
