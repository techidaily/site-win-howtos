1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**I** key together to open Settings.
2. Go to**Apps** \>**Installed apps** . Find the**NVIDIA app** and**Uninstall** it.

## Solution 3: Temporarily turn off any antivirus software or firewall

 Some antivirus software would block certain files, which prevents you from successfully completing your installation. For example many “Comodo” antivirus users have reported that it causes NVIDIA driver updates to fail. So if you’re running antivirus software or a firewall, your might need to turn them off during your installation. You’ll also need to make sure all their processes are turned off. You can check and kill all processes via your Task Manager.

 After installing the driver, remember to re-enable your antivirus software and firewall to help keep your PC safe.

 To temporarily disable your antivirus software and firewall, follow the steps below:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box. Type**taskmgr** and hit**Enter** .

## Solution 5: Try a clean installation with DDU

 Another very common reason for NVIDIA Installer failed error is an outdated or faulty graphics card driver files in your computer. In this case, it’s recommended that you do a clean reinstallation of the Nvidia display card driver. To do so, DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) is usually recommended, as it can do a pretty good job removing all the older or faulty display driver files on your computer.

To do a clean reinstallation of the display card driver with DDU:

1. Download and search for the execution file of the display card driver from the website of your GPU manufacturer **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
2. Download DDU from the[**official download page**](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) . Then unzip the folder, and double-click the**DDU** file to further extract the execution file.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-3.png)
3. Boot your computer into Safe Mode as instructed here:[**Start Safe Mode using the System Configuration tool**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. When in Safe Mode, go to the folder where you unzip the DDU execution file. Double-click to run**Display Driver Uninstaller** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-2.png)
5. Select **GPU** and **your GPU manufacturer** on the right side. Then click **Clean and restart** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-1.png)
6. Your computer should restart when the old driver files for your graphics card are cleaned.
7. Double-click the setup file for the display card driver you’ve downloaded from step 1 to run the driver installation.
8. Restart your computer afterward.
