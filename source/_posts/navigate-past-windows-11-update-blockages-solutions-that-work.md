### Method 3: Reset the Windows Update related components

 Your Windows Update may fail to install the updates because its components are corrupted. These components include the services and temporary files and folders associated with Windows Update. You can try resetting these components and see if this fixes your problem.

To reset these components:

1. Click the**Start** button in the lower left corner of your screen, then type “_**cmd**_ “. In the list of results, right-click**Command Prompt** and select**Run as administrator** . ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a012175c9a76.png)
2. In Command Prompt, type the following lines of command and press**Enter** on your keyboard after typing each:  
   * net stop bits  
   * net stop wuauserv  
   * net stop appidsvc  
   * net stop cryptsvc  
    These commands will stop the services that Windows Update requires to download and install updates.
3. Type these lines of command and press**Enter** after typing each in Command Prompt:  
   * ren %systemroot%\softwaredistribution softwaredistribution.old  
   * ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.old  
    This will rename the SoftwareDistribution and catroot2 folder, which are used by Windows Update to store data and temporary files. Your system will detect that these folders are missing, and then it’ll create new ones. The purpose of this is to force the system to use the new SoftwareDistribution and catroot2 folders so that Windows Update can avoid issues with the old ones.
4. In Command Prompt, type these commands and press**Enter** after each to restart the services you closed just now:  
   * net start bits  
   * net start wuauserv  
   * net start appidsvc  
   * net start cryptsvc
5. Check your Windows Update to see if it’s able to install your update.

 If it is, then you’ve solved your problem. But if not, you may need to…

### Method 4: Set your Windows Update services to start automatically

1. Click the**Start** button in the lower left corner of your screen, then type “_**cmd**_ “. In the list of results, right-click**Command Prompt** and select**Run as administrator** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_5a012175c9a76.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. In Command Prompt, type the following lines of command and press**Enter** on your keyboard after typing each line:  
   * SC config bits start= auto  
   * SC config cryptsvc start= auto  
   * SC config trustedinstaller start= auto
