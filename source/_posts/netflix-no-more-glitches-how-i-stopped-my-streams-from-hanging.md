 1) On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and type**users** . Then  click**Users** .

* If yes, rename the folder**cache.old** . Create a new folder and name it**cache** . Close the window.
* If no, create a new folder and name it**cache** . Close the window.

 4) Restart your computer and run the Windows apps troubleshooter again. This time, it’ll not only report the issue and probably solve it too.
