### Solution 1: Reset your PS4 controller

 Generally, the PS4 controller not charging issue is caused by the malfunctioned controller itself. So, as the initial solution, we recommend you reset your PS4 controller.

You can easily reset your controller through these several steps:

1. Find**the reset button** on your controller: it’s a very small hole on the back of your controller and under the L2 button.

2. Put a toothpick or a similar object into the reset hole; press the button; hold it down for a few seconds and then release.
3. Your controller should then restart. Once it gets started, try to charge it again to see if successful.

### Solution 2: Charge your PS4 controller upside down

 Please charge your PS4 controller upside down when you encounter the not charging problem. Sounds wired? It helps a lot of PS4 players get their controller to charge again. You can give it a shot to see if it works.

Just put your PS4 controller upside down and then charge it.

1. Charge your other controller if you have one with the same charging USB cable.
2. If the other controller does charge, then the problem is on your cable’s side. Please skip to the following solution. If the other controller also does not charge, it seems there’s something wrong with your USB cable. Please go on with the next step.
3. Try to use the official charging USB cable coming with your PS4 console to charge your controller.

**Note:** Some USB cable have the same connectors though, they can have different specs. That’s why your PS4 controller cannot charge if you use some third-party USB cable.  
 So please**use an official charging USB cable** to charge your controller. If you lost the USB cable coming with your PS4, you can buy an official one from Sony.

### Solution 4: Check the charging port of your PS4 controller

 Like the charging cable, a bad charging port on your PS4 controller could also prevent your controller from charging.

 Follow to check if there’s something wrong with your charging port:

 Charge your other controller if you have one with the same charging USB cable. If the other controller does charge, there’s probably some problem with the charging port with your not charging controller. You then need to replace the charging port with a new one. If you’re not sure how to do it, you can ask for help from[the official PlayStation website](http://www.playstation.com/) .

### Solution 5: Replace the batteries of your PS4 controller

 If you’ve tried all the solutions above and your controller still cannot charge, do not be frustrated. Be sure to try this last but helpful solution.

 If you’ve used your PS4 controller for a long time, the batteries of your controller might lose their charges and die due to recharging again and again. So try to replace it with new PS4 batteries and see if works.

 Note: Please feel free to replace the batteries of your controller as it won’t affect the warranty of your PS4.
