### **Fix 1: Check if your PC meets the minimum system requirements for Nier Automata**

 Nier Automata may crash if your PC fails to meet its minimum hardware requirements. Check if your PC meets its minimum hardware requirements first:

 **The minimum system requirements for Nier Automata:**

| **OS**        | Windows 7/8.1/10 64 bit       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Processor** | Intel i3 2100 OR AMD A8-6500  |

| **Screen**    | 1270×720                      |

 As we all know, it’s never the ideal way to play Nier Automata with a PC which just meets its minimum hardware requirements. So we also list the recommended system requirements for**Nier Automata** below.

**The recommended system requirements for Nier Automata**   **:**

### **Fix 2: Install the latest game patch**

 The developers of**Nier Automata** will keep releasing game patches to fix bugs. You can install the latest patch which may have triggered this issue.

 After installing the latest game patch, run Nier Automata to see if the issue has been resolved. If this issue still there, or there’s no new game patch released, move to the next fix.

### **Fix 3: Update or reinstall your drivers**

**Option 1–Automatically**

 Use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to automatically update your driver with 2 clicks (

### **Fix 4: Close FAR(Fix Automata Resolution) Mod**

 Fix Automata Resolution (FAR) is developed by Nier Automata. By manipulating the graphics requirements of the game, users with lower specs can play the game. But FAR can be the reason for the Nier Automata crashing problem.

 If you have already enabled FAR mod, you can disable it and restore the game settings to default to solve the problem. Then restart your computer to check whether it solves the problem or not.

2. Type “taskmgr” and press**Enter** to open the Task Manager.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/task.jpg)
