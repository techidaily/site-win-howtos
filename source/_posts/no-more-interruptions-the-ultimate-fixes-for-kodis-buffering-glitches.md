## Method 1: Update DirectX

 DirectX is developed by Microsoft which mainly handles multimedia tasks especially games and videos. If it has problems, you may not watch videos or play games.

 Before you head to download the latest version of DirectX, you may want to check the current version of DirectX installed on your computer.

 1) On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke the run command. Type**dxdiag** then click**OK** . This is to open DirectX Disgnostic Tool.

 2) When DirectX Diagnostic Tool window pops up, you’ll see the DirectX Version under**System** tab. In the following screenshot, the DirectX Version is DirectX 12.

## Update DirectX to the latest version

 All Windows Operating systems include DirectX. Microsoft would update DirectX and release the new versions through Windows Update. So you can update the DirectX by downloading and installing the latest Windows Update. You may know how to download and install the Windows Update. But if not, the following steps may help:

1) Open Windows Update:

If you’re using Windows 7, 8 & 8.1, follow these steps:

 a) On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke the run command. Type**control panel** then click**OK** . This is to open**Control Panel** .

 b) View by Small icons, click**Windows Update** .

If you’re using Windows 10, follow these steps:

 a) On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (Windows logo and R key) at the same time to invoke the run command. Type**ms-settings:windowsupdate** and click**OK** .

 2) Click**Check for updates** . Then Windows will check for the updates. After that completes, you’ll see the number of important updates and optional updates. You can click on either of them to check for the if update for DirectX is available.

**IMPORTANT:** Each Windows version has its own supported DirectX version. For**Windows 10** , the latest supported version is**DirectX 12** . For**Windows 8** , the latest supported version is**DirectX 11.1** . For**Windows 8.1** , the latest supported version is DirectX 11.2\. For Windows 7, the latest supported version is**DirectX 11.1** . If you want to install higher version for Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7, you need to upgrade your operating system.

## Method 2: Use VPN

### Why you should use a VPN?

 If you run into **No stream available** error or can’t just play video with Kodi, the video content may be blocked by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) or attacked by hackers.

 Kodi is a great media player software which allows you to watch any videos you like for free. But sometimes if you use add-ons to watch the videos with copyright, your ISP may detect it and think this violates the copyright laws (Different country has different copyright laws.). Then they will block the content. Hackers who dislike such behavior may also want to block the content. So when you use Kodi to watch videos, it’s recommended you use a VPN.

 VPN can protect your privacy information from being easily known by ISP or hackers. With a VPN, your ISP or hacker is not able to know who you are and what you’re doing. That means you’re safe when you use Kodi to watch any videos even videos with copyright.

 I don’t recommend watching video without paying if you need to. We should respect other people’s hard work, right? 🙂

### Use NordVPN

 If you’re not sure what product you can trust, you can use **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , so you don’t need to spend much time on further searching.

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) NordVPN to your computer (You can get a 75% discount if you purchase the product right now.).

2) Run NordVPN and open it.

3) Connect to a server by choosing a country you want to connect to.

## Method 3: Update add-ons

 If you’ve installed add-ons to enjoy more features such as the well-known Exodus and Covenant. You Kodi not working could be due to the add-ons. If you’ve just installed one add-on, it’s fine. You just need to update it. But if you’ve installed more than one add-on, you might need to take some time to update them all.

---

## Method 4: Remove add-ons

 If the problem occurs after installing one specific add-on, the add-on could probably be the cause. In this case, uninstalling the add-on could resolve the problem. If you’ve installed more than one add-on and not sure which one is exactly the cause, remove them one by one and see if the problem resolves.
