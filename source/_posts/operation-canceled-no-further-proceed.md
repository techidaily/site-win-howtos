### Method 2: Update your keyboard driver and HID driver

An old, corrupted or missing**keyboard driver**or**HID (Human interface device) driver**could also caused your Toshiba laptop keys, especially your Fn keys, not to working. So we recommend updating your keyboard and HID drivers. You can get the correct device drivers either manually or automatically.**Manual driver update –**You can update your keyboard and HID drivers manually by going to the official Toshiba website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows system type.**Automatic driver update –**If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your keyboard and HID drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .
