### Method 2: Update your keyboard driver and HID driver

An old, corrupted or missing**keyboard driver**or**HID (Human interface device) driver**could also caused your Toshiba laptop keys, especially your Fn keys, not to working. So we recommend updating your keyboard and HID drivers. You can get the correct device drivers either manually or automatically.**Manual driver update –**You can update your keyboard and HID drivers manually by going to the official Toshiba website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows system type.**Automatic driver update –**If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your keyboard and HID drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baeef7a4bd26.jpg)
3. Click **Update**  next to the flagged keyboard or HID driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support** and a**30-day money back** guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baef3772a4b2.jpg)

### Method 3: Clean your keyboard with a compressed air duster
