## Fix 1: Install the latest drivers

 When your computer crashes when you play games, one of the first things to do is to ensure that your drivers are all updated, especially the graphics card drivers.

 There are two ways you can update your drivers: manually and automatically.

**Update your drivers manually** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it, and install it step by step.

**OR**

**Update your drivers automatically** – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## Fix 2: Disable background programs

 Games are usually CPU- and RAM-intensive, i.e., they occupy a large chunk of your computer processor and memory resources. When too many unnecessary applications run in the background when a game is on, your computer resources are strained and could crash if it reaches an extreme point. In this case, it’s suggested that you disable unnecessary background programs when playing games. To do so:

**On Windows 10:**

1. Press**Ctrl+ Shift+ Esc** together to evoke Task Manager.
2. Select each resource-hogging application and click**End Task** to close them one by one.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892107/21290" target="_top" id="1892107"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892107" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892107/21290" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/task.jpg)
3. Play the game and see if your computer still crashes. If so, please move on.

**On Windows 11:**

1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-48.png)
2. Select each resource-hogging application and click**End Task** to close them one by one.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-49.png)

 Then run your game again and see if your computer crashes still. If the problem remains, please move on to the next fix below.

## Fix 3: Verify the game files

 Corrupted or missing files in games could also be the culprit to the game crashes or even computer crash problems. To see if this is the case, you can verify your game files on the following game launchers:

* **[Epic Games Launcher](#epic)**
* **[Ubisoft Connect](#ubisoft)**
* **[Steam](#steam)**

### **Epic Games Launcher**

To verify the game’s files on Epic Games Launcher:

1. On Epic Game Launcher, find the game with problem in your **Library** . Click **the three dots** on the right side of the game line and select**Manage** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-28.png)
2. Click **Verify** to start verifying the game files.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

### Ubisoft Connect

To verify the game’s files on Ubisoft Connect:

1. Open Ubisoft Connect, and find the game with problem under the**Games** tab.
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12730965&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/w5/03_WBSX5_728x90_red_CTA.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

4. Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.
5. Then see if this game still crashes your computer. If so, please move on.

 If you’re using other game launcher, and you’re not sure how to verify the game files, please check the game launcher’s support manual or forum.

## Fix 4: Check for software conflict

 Another very common reason why your computer crashes when playing a game is conflicting software programs running in the background. Some mentioned products include VPN software, antivirus programs, overclocking software like Rivatuner, and even certain resource monitoring programs like MSI Afterburner.

 Here are programs usually mentioned in forums as possible conflicting software. Check and see if you have them installed:

* NZXT CAM
* MSI Afterburner
* Razer Cortex (if you have Razer products, try to make sure their drivers are updated to the latest version)
* Anti-virus or anti-spyware software
* VPN, proxy, or other firewall and security software
* P2P or file-sharing software
* IP filtering or blocking software
* Download manager programs

 Most of the suspicious software is related to network connection or download, so if you don’t have the above-mentioned software installed, see if you have other software programs that’ll occupy your network resource.

 If you’ve ensured that you have no such program installed, but your computer still crashes when a game is on, please move on to the next fix below.

### Fix 5.3 – Prevent your computer from overheating

 If your computer crashes easily without any error notification or message beforehand when you’re playing games, you should check to see if your computer is overheated.

 Free tools like AIDA64, HWInfo, or CoreTemp can help you monitor your computer’s CPU, GPU, and other hardware components’ temperatures. To see if the overheated computer is the culprit to your computer crashing when playing games problem, please:

1. Install one of the tools mentioned above.
2. Leave it on when you play games.
3. Refer to this post: **[How to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to tell if your computer is overheated with the readings on the tool, and then decide what to do if it’s really running too hot.

 When you’ve ensured that your computer is not running too hot when a game is running but it still crashes, please move on to the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5.4 – Check your power supply

 Other than the issues mentioned above, insufficient power supply could also be the culprit to your computer crashes when playing a game problem.

 To see if your computer has problems with its power supply, you can check more detailed information here: **[Make sure that your PSU is powerful enough](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Long story short, you’ll need third-party tools (available for free) to run more tests to see if hardware components are the reason why your computer crashes when playing games. If you don’t have the time or patience to do so, you can always seek help from a hardware technician instead.

---

### Fix 5.5 – Upgrade your hardware devices

 If none of the above tests or modifications prove effective, it’s possible that the problem is with your older computer hardware devices. For instance, games rely heavily on processors and GPUs. If such devices are too old, even though they meet the minimum system requirements for the games, there are still chances that they become too fragile when the game runs, and therefore crashes.

---

 That’s it. Hope the above fixes can meet your needs. If you have any other suggestion or ideas, please feel free to leave a comment below. Enjoy your game!
