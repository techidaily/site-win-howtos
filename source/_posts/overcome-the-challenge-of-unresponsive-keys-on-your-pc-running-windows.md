### Fix 1: Remove any USB peripherals and wait for the update process to finish

 If you seldom check for Windows updates, it may take a long time for Windows to complete the update process. Maybe your PC is not “stuck” at Windows update, and Windows is just configuring and installing update packages.

 If you temporarily don’t need to use your PC, you can just wait for 2 to 3 hours to see if the update process can be completed. If there are any USB devices (like printers, USB flash drives, etc.) connected to your PC, you can try removing them from your PC. Some Windows users reported that after they disconnect all the USB peripherals from their PCs, the update process completes quickly.

 See if this issue persists after you wait for 2 to 3 hours. If it persists, try the next fix below to force restart your PC.

5. Press the power button again to reboot your system.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 net stop bits  
 net stop wuauserv  
 net stop appidsvc  
 net stop cryptsvc  

 Note: The Windows Update-related system services will be stopped after executing the command lines above.
3. In Command Prompt, type the following command lines and press Enter after typing each:  

 ren %systemroot%\\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old  
 ren %systemroot%\\system32\\catroot2 catroot2.old  

 Note: You will rename the SoftwareDistribution and catroot2 folder as SoftwareDistribution.old and catroot2.old after you run these two command lines. These two folders are used by Windows Update to save temporary update files.  

 By renaming these two folders, Windows will think these two folders are missing, and Windows will create new ones to store Windows update files. By doing that, you can avoid many Windows Update issues caused by the old corrupted temporary files in these two folders.
4. In Command Prompt, type the following command lines and press Enter after each:  

 net start bits  
 net start wuauserv  
 net start appidsvc  
 net start cryptsvc  

 Note: After you execute the command lines above, you start the Windows Update-related system services.

 Check to see if this resolves your Windows Update problem. Hopefully, it did. But if not, try the next fix, below.
