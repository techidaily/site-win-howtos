## Trouble with Driver Power State Failure? Here’s How to Fix It

If you encounter a blue screen error with the message**DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE** , you can try using solutions here to fix the issue.

[Stop 0x0000009F (DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE)](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Stop-0x0000009F-DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE-500x332.png) ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Stop-0x0000009F-DRIVER%5FPOWER%5FSTATE%5FFAILURE.png)

 As you can see from the blue screen, the**DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE** error has a value of 0x0000009F which indicates that the driver is in an inconsistent or invalid power state. The error most probably is caused by the incompatibility between your PC’s power management and one or more installed drivers. It normally occurs during one of the following power state transitions:

* Going to or returning from Sleep mode
* Going to or returning from Hibernate mode
* Shutting down or starting computer

**To resolve the problem, you can try updating the drivers.**

 The**Network Card** ,**Wireless Card** and the**Video Card drivers** could most probably be the reason. If you are not sure which driver you need to update, you can try updating these three drivers on each to the latest version and see if the problem resolves. You can go to your PC manufacturer’s website to find and download the latest drivers.

 It can be a little hard to find and download drivers manually. You need to know about your PC information and operating system. So you can use[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to help update drivers. Driver Easy will detect all problem drivers on your computer. Then download new appropriate drivers. With Driver Easy, you can fix this error in several minutes if the issue is caused by problem drivers.

 After updating drivers, if the problem still persists, you can try the fixes below.

## Fix 1: Roll Back Drivers

 If the error occurs after you install new drivers, you can try restoring the drivers to the previous version.

 1) Go to[Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and expand the category to locate the device with problematic drivers.

 1) Go to**Programs and Features** .

 2) Uninstall the software.

 3) Reboot your PC.

## Fix 3: Disconnect Peripherals from your PC

1) Turn off your computer.

2) Remove the device.

3) Turn on the computer again.

## Fix 4: Repair Problematic System Files

 The error would occur if some system files are damaged or corrupted. Follow the methods below to try repairing problematic system files.

* [Option 1- Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-driver-power-state-failure-error/#reimage)  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Windows common issues. It will deal with issues related to system errors, and critical system files and find the right fix for you.
* Option 2 – Manually  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there are any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

It will first check hardware-related issues to identify problems, and then security issues, and finally it detects programs that crash, and missing system files. Once complete, it will find a solution to your specific problem.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
