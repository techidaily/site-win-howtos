 The error can be caused by hardware issues. So first, follow below simple instructions to do the troubleshooting.

**1\. Try the device on a different USB port.** This will figure out if the problem is caused by a broken port.
  
 2\. Connect the device to another PC. This will figure out if the external device has a problem.

 If there is no problem with the USB port and the device, read on and try the following methods. You can start at the top of the list and work your way down.

[**Method 1: Remove the Power Supply**](#method1)
[**Method 2: Uninstall the USB Driver in Device Manager**](#method2)
[**Method 3 : Update the USB Driver**](#method3)
[**Method 4: Disable Fast Startup**](#method4)
[**Method 5: Change the USB Selective Suspend Settings**](#method5)

## **Method 1: Remove the Power Supply**

 This method will fix the problem magically if the problem is caused by Power Supply.

1\. Remove the Power Supply plug from the PC.

2\. Re-plug in the Power Supply.

3\. Restart the PC and connect the device to the USB port.

## **Method 2: Uninstall the USB Driver in Device Manager**

 2\. Right-click on the device and select**Uninstall** from the context menu.
