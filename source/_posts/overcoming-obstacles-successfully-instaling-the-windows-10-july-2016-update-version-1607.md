## **Method 4:** Repair system files

 The 0x800705b4 Error may be related to system files. When the system files were broken or corrupted, it may cause a Blue screen issue.

There are 2 ways to solve it. Here’s how:

* [Option 1- Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fix-0x800705b4-update-error-in-windows-10/#reimage)  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Windows common issues. It will deal with issues related to system errors, and critical system files and find the right fix for you.
* Option 2 – Manually  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there are any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your computer and fix them immediately.

It will first check hardware-related issues to identify problems, and then security issues, and finally it detects programs that crash, and missing system files. Once complete, it will find a solution to your specific problem.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

4. Once done, you’ll see a detailed report of all the issues on your PC. To fix them automatically, click**Start Repair** . This requires you to purchase the full version. But don’t worry. If Fortect doesn’t solve the issue, you can request a refund within 60 days.

#### Option 2 – Manually

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and the **R** key at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **cmd** and press **Shift** +**Ctrl** +**Enter** together on your keyboard to open Command Prompt in the administrator mode.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Snap825.jpg)
**Note** : Do **NOT** click OK or just press the Enter key as that won’t allow you to open Command Prompt in the administrator mode.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snap4.jpg)

 4) Restart your computer to check the blue screen issue is fixed or not.

 If the result indicates there are broken files but SFC can’t fix them, you can turn to [Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) Tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) for deeper examination and repair.

## Method 5: Perform a Clean Boot then Install the Updates Again

 If you are not sure how to perform a clean boot, see [How to Perform a Clean Boot in Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## Method 6: Update the Drivers

 The steps above may resolve the problem, but if they don’t, it’s time to update the drivers. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the drivers manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-440.png)

 3) Click the **Update** button next to one driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
