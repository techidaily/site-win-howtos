### **Fix 2: Change the download region**

 Technically, the Steam content system is divided into different regions. Your Steam client auto-detects what region you’re in and sets it as default. There are times when some servers have the overload problem, hence the **missing file privileges** error. If that’s the case, you can**change the download region** to make things work again:

 1) Open Steam. Then click**Steam** \>**Settings** .
