### Fix 1: Troubleshoot problems with your printer

#### 1\. Make sure your printer is set as the default printer

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**control** and click**OK** .”

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f0363012f57.png)

#### 2\. Make sure your printer driver is up-to-date

 The latest printer driver enables your printer to work fine. An old, corrupted, or missing printer driver would make you cannot print PDF files. Follow these to update your printer driver to solve your problem:

1. Go to the official website of your printer manufacturer, like[**HP**](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers) ,[**Dell**](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fsupport%2Fhome%2Fus%2Fen%2F04%3Fapp%3Ddrivers) ,[**Canon**](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/) ,[**Brother**](http://www.brother-usa.com/Support/) .
2. Go to the specific driver-download page and find the correct latest driver for your printer.
3. Download and install the driver on your computer.
4. Restart your computer and try to print your PDF file in Adobe to see if it works.

 Alternatively, you can update your printer driver automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , if you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy. Then run it on your Windows.
2. Click **Scan Now** . It will quickly detect all driver’s problems with your computer. Your printer driver is no exception.

### Fix 3: Scan your computer to detect issues

 Can’t print PDFs but worry about wasting too much time troubleshooting? You can perform a complete scan on your PC to locate the exact problem.

1. **[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](#reimage)**  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of your printer problems. It will deal with issues related to system errors, and critical system files and find the right fix for you.
2. **[Option 2 – Manually](https://ukaidot.sjv.io/daqnoj)**  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there is any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your computer and fix them immediately.

 Fortect Windows Repair is tailored to your specific system and is working in a private and automatic way. It will first check hardware-related issues to identify problems, and then security issues (powered by Avira Antivirus), and finally it detects programs that crash, missing system files. Once complete, it will find a solution to your specific problem.

 Fortect is a trusted repair tool and it will not harm your PC. The best part is that you won’t need to worry about losing any programs and your personal data.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect and run a free scan. This might take 3\~5 minutes to fully analyze your PC. Once complete, you will be able to review the detailed scan report.

 3) You’ll see the summary of detected issues on your PC. Click **Start Repair** and all the issues will be fixed automatically. (You’ll need to purchase the full version which comes with full technical support. )

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-repair.jpg)

#### Option 2 – Manually

 To check and restore your system file might take time and computer skills. You will need to run numerous commands, wait for the process to complete, or risk your personal data.

##### Step 1\. Scan**corrupt files with System File Checker**

 System File Checker (SFC) is a Windows built-in tool to identify and repair corrupted system files.

 1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and R at the same time to open the Run box. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/windows11-cmd.jpg)

 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt, type the following command and hit**Enter** .

sfc /scannow

 3) System File Check will begin to scan all system files and repair any corrupted or missing ones it detected. This may take 3-5 minutes.

![Windows 11 - System File Checker](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-sfc-scannow.jpg)

 4) You may receive something like the following messages after the verification.

* no errors
* it fixed some errors
* could not fix all errors
* could not fix errors at all
* ……

 No matter what message you receive, you can try running**dism.exe** (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) to further scan the health of your PC.

##### Step 2.**Run dism.exe**

1) Run Command Prompt as admin and enter the following commands.

* This command line will scan the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

* This command line will restore the health of your PC:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

 2) After the restore health process finishes, you may get some error messages.

* If restoring health gives you errors, you can always try this command line. This will take up to 2 hours.

dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

* If you get **Error: 0x800F081F** with the restore health scan, reboot your PC and run this command line.

Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore

 Restart your PC after repairing the corrupt files and test your printer.

1. Restart your computer.
2. Open your PDF file in Acrobat Reader and try to print it to see if successful. If a simple restart cannot solve your problem, reinstall your Acrobat Reader with the latest version with the following steps.
3. Type features in the search box from Start. Then click Apps & features.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f03ff1ce57c.png)
4. Find your Acrobat Reader, then Uninstall.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f040401a2b4.jpg)
