 The error can be caused by hardware issues. So first, follow below simple instructions to do the troubleshooting.

**1\. Try the device on a different USB port.** This will figure out if the problem is caused by a broken port.
  
 2\. Connect the device to another PC. This will figure out if the external device has a problem.

[**Method 1: Remove the Power Supply**](#method1)

## **Method 1: Remove the Power Supply**

 This method will fix the problem magically if the problem is caused by Power Supply.

3\. Restart the PC and connect the device to the USB port.
