## Method 1: Connect your device with another USB port

This problem could be caused by the USB port your device is plugged in. Please**try another USB port**and be sure to connect your device**directly to your computer**. That is to say,**don’t**use any USB hub or extension cables to connect your devices. Once you do, check if the error still pops up.

## Method 2: Update your USB controller driver

If you**USB controller driver**is old or corrupted, the problem may also occurs. So be sure to update your USB controller driver if you have the problem. You can either update your USB controller driver manually or automatically.**Manual driver update –**You can update your video driver manually by going to the**manufacturer’s website**for your**brand computer**or**motherboard**, and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose the only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows system.**Automatic driver update –**If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your USB controller driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your USB controller, and your variant of Windows system, and it will download and install it correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b9b64d36354d.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.) Note: You can do it**for free** if you like, but it’s partly manual.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b9b649a0def7.jpg)
