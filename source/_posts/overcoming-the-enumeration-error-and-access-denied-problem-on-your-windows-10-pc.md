## Overcoming the Mystery of Failed USB Recognition in Windows - Fixed Now

 If your external USB device is not recognized by Windows 10, and meet Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed) error in Device Manager, use solutions here to troubleshoot and fix the error.

 As you have noticed, the USB Device in[Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) has a yellow triangle on it:

 The error can be caused by hardware issues. So first, follow below simple instructions to do the troubleshooting.

**1\. Try the device on a different USB port.** This will figure out if the problem is caused by a broken port.
  
 2\. Connect the device to another PC. This will figure out if the external device has a problem.

 If there is no problem with the USB port and the device, read on and try the following methods. You can start at the top of the list and work your way down.

[**Method 1: Remove the Power Supply**](#method1)
[**Method 2: Uninstall the USB Driver in Device Manager**](#method2)
[**Method 3 : Update the USB Driver**](#method3)
[**Method 4: Disable Fast Startup**](#method4)
[**Method 5: Change the USB Selective Suspend Settings**](#method5)

## **Method 1: Remove the Power Supply**

 This method will fix the problem magically if the problem is caused by Power Supply.

1\. Remove the Power Supply plug from the PC.

2\. Re-plug in the Power Supply.

3\. Restart the PC and connect the device to the USB port.

## **Method 2: Uninstall the USB Driver in Device Manager**

Follow these steps:

 1\. Open Device Manager and expand the category Universal Serial Bus Controllers and locate the USB device that is not being recognized by Windows.

 2\. Right-click on the device and select**Uninstall** from the context menu.

 3\. After finishing the uninstallation, restart your PC then Windows will reinstall the device automatically.

## **Method 3 : Update the USB Driver**

 The problem can be caused by a faulty USB driver. In this case, updating the driver would fix the problem.

 If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually,  you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.
