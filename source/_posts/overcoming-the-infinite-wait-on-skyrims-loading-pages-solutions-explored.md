 If you uninstall other applications before this issue happened, it’s possible you may uninstall USB or related drivers accidentally. The outdated or missing drivers can cause problems to your computer and it’s important to keep your drivers up-to-date for a better user experience.

 You can download products drivers from its manufacturer official website. You have to search your model name to find the correct model and choose your specific flavor of Windows system (Window 10 64-bits or etc.) Then download the driver manually.
