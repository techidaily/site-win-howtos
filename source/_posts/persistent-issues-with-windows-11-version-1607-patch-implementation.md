## Method 2: Reset the Windows Update components

You may fail to install the 1607 update because the**Windows Update components**on your computer are corrupted. These components include the services and temporary files required by or related to Windows Update. You can try resetting these components and see if this can fix your problem. To reset the Windows Update components:**1)**Click the**Start**button in the lower left corner of your screen, then type “_**cmd**_“. In the list of results, right click**Command Prompt**and select**Run as administrator**.

**2)** In Command Prompt, type the following lines of command and press**Enter**on your keyboard after typing each:

* _**net stop bits**_
* _**net stop wuauserv**_
* _**net stop appidsvc**_
* _**net stop cryptsvc**_

* _**Ren %systemroot%\\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old**_
* _**Ren %systemroot%\\system32\\catroot2 catroot2.old**_
(This will rename the_SoftwareDistribution_and_catroot2_folder, which are used by Windows Update to store data and temporary files. Your system will detect that these folders are missing, and then it’ll create new ones. The purpose of this is to make the system use the new_SoftwareDistribution_and _catroot2_folders so that Windows Update can avoid issues from the old ones.)**4)**Still in Command Prompt, type these commands and press Enter after each to restart the services you closed just now:
* _**net start bits**_
* _**net start wuauserv**_
* _**net start appidsvc**_
* _**net start cryptsvc**_

## Method 4: Temporarily disable your antivirus software

Sometimes your system can’t install new updates due to the interference from your**antivirus software**. You can temporarily disable your antivirus and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus program documentation for instructions on disabling it.) If this resolves the problem, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different solution.**IMPORTANT:**Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.
