## Try these fixes

You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Press Tab when parachuting**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Move your game files to your SSD (if you have one)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/pubg-buildings-not-loading-fixed/#b)
3. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Reinstall your game**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Press Tab when parachuting

To fix your game graphics issue, you can make your game load the building texture before landing. To do so, when your parachute is pulled out, press the**Tab**key on your keyboard to bring up the inventory screen. Your game may freeze for a while, as it’s loading the texture. After that, check to see if this fixes your texture issues. Hopefully it does. But if not, there are still three fixes for you to try…

### Method 2: Move your game files to your SSD (if you have one)

If you’re using an solid-state drive (SSD), you should try moving your games file there to speed up the loading process. To move your game files to your SSD:**1)** On your Steam client, click**Steam**, then click**Settings**.

### Method 4: Reinstall your game

Your PUBG files may have been corrupted so you are having the texture loading issues. You can reinstall your game to repair the corrupted files. After that, run your game and, if this method helps you, you should see the texture of buildings is fully loaded. We hope one of these fixes works for you!
