### Fix 1: Check your keyboard

 If you’re using a defective keyboard, you may encounter the**Ctrl + Alt + Del** not working issue. You can use another keyboard or connect your keyboard to another PC to check whether this issue is caused by your keyboard or not.

### Fix 2: Update your keyboard driver

 If your keyboard driver is outdated or corrupted, it may also trigger this issue. In this case, you should try to update your keyboard driver.  
  
 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time-consuming and risky, so we won’t cover it here. If you’re not comfortable working on computers, it is recommended that you download **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to update your keyboard driver.  
  
 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem driver.

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to your keyboard to automatically download the correct driver for this device, then you can manually install it. You can also click**Update All** button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click on**Update All** ).
