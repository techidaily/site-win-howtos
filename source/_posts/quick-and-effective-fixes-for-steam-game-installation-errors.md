## Steam Game Installation Errors? Here's How to Fix Them

For game players, Steam is the window of the world of gaming. But there are situations in which you cannot even download or install the game updates. And you probably got the error messages **“An error occurred while installing/ updating…”** . Without access to your favorite games, you might be quite anxious. But don’t worry, in this article, you’ll definitely fix the issue by trying some methods.

 Before performing any troubleshooting steps listed below, you should restart your computer. This action refreshes the operating system and removes any corrupt temporary data that could be causing the problem.

## Try these fixes

 You may not need to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

1. **[Run Steam as administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Allow Steam through Firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Change the download region](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Clear download cache](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Disable unnecessary programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 1) Right-click on the shortcut and select**Run as Administrator** .

 (If granting Steam with administrative rights didn’t solve the issue, proceed to the next[fix2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . )

 3) Exit Steam and make sure it’s not running in the background. You can press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box. Type in**taskmgr** and press**Enter** . Navigate to all the Steam services. Right-click on each and select**End task** .

 4) Right-click on the shortcut and select**Open file location** .
