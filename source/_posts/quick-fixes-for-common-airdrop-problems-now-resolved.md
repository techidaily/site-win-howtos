### **Step 2: Make sure all the devices are within detected range**

 As mentioned, AirDrop works based on WiFi and Bluetooth, so your devices must be within the WiFi and Bluetooth range to be able to detected. You can’t AirDrop to users who are out of the defined range.

 It’s recommended to be as**closer** as possible when using AirDrop, and do not beyond**20 feet** (**6 meters** ), which may make your device undiscoverable.

### **Step 3: Turn off your AirPlane mode**

 The Airplane mode cuts off your iPhone’s connection to all wireless networks, both cellular and Wi-Fi, so your AirDrop won’t be working if your AirPlane mode is on.

 1)**Swipe** **up** from the bottom of your device screen.

 2) Tap the**Airplane** button to turn it off. The button is grey if it’s turned off.

 3) Try your AirDrop again to see if it works.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **Step 4: Make sure your device screen is on when using AirDrop**

 If the iOS device screen is off when AirDrop items, you would fail to send/receive the items. So**make sure your iOS device screen is on** when using AirDrop.

 As for Mac, you can use AirDrop when your Mac screen is off, but make sure it’s**not in sleep mode** . Sleep mode will stop AirDrop from working properly, too.

### **Step 5: Do not to transfer files of different types**

 For now, you can transfer many types of files by AirDrop, but you can’t transfer different types of files at one time with AirDrop. Please make sure you**transfer the same type of file once a time** .

---

## **Method 2: Resign in your iCloud account**

 The AirDrop not working issue can be caused by the iCloud issue.**Signing out and Signing in again** can solve the problem.

**Note** : Both the devices that using AirDrop need to be signed in the iCloud account.

 1) Go to**Settings** , and tap**your name** to go to**iCloud** .

 4) Enter your**account** and**password** to sign in.

 5) Try your AirDrop again to see if it works.

 If you have turned on AirDrop, WiFi and Bluetooth will turn on automatically. You can try to turn off WiFi and Bluetooth and turn them on.

 1) Go to**Settings** \>**WLAN** .

 2) Tap**WLAN** button to turn it off, and tap again to turn it on.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **Method 4: Check Personal Hotspot**

 This is a step that people may forget to check: Personal Hotsopt. It lets you share the cellular data connection of your iPhone or iPad (Wi-Fi + Cellular) when you don’t have access to a Wi-Fi network.

 However, Personal Hotspot being used may stop AirDrop from working, because the**Personal Hotspot feature is relied on WiFi** , too. You can try to temporarily turn off Personal Hotspot.

 1) Go to**Settings** \>**Personal** **Hotspot** .

 2) Tap the button next to**Personal Hotspot** to turn it off.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3) Reopen your AirDrop and try it again.

## **Method 5: Check Do Not Disturb Mode**

 The Do Not Disturb mode helps you to silence calls, alerts and notifications that you receive on your iOS devices. If you are in the Do Not Disturb mode, your AirDrop will not be working. You can try to temporarily disable the Do Not Disturb mode.

 1)**Swipe** **up** from the bottom of the device screen.

 2) Tap the**moon** **icon** to turn off Do Not Disturb mode. The button will be lit up if it’s on, and it becomes grey when it’s off.

 WiFi network is an important factor to have AirDrop to be working. Check your WiFi network by these steps:

 1) Go to**Settings** \>**General** \>**Reset** .
