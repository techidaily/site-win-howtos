### **Step 2: Make sure all the devices are within detected range**

 As mentioned, AirDrop works based on WiFi and Bluetooth, so your devices must be within the WiFi and Bluetooth range to be able to detected. You can’t AirDrop to users who are out of the defined range.

### **Step 3: Turn off your AirPlane mode**

 1)**Swipe** **up** from the bottom of your device screen.

 2) Tap the**Airplane** button to turn it off. The button is grey if it’s turned off.
