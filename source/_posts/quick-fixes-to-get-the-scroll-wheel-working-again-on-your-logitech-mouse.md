### Method 1: Lower in-game settings

 Some games have specific minimum system requirements for your system to be able to play them seamlessly. If your computer has met the minimum system requirements of the game, you can try lowering in-game settings and see if this helps unfreeze your computer. If not, try Method 2, below.

### Method 2: Update your drivers

 A missing or outdated device driver may also stop your game from running. You should update your device drivers, especially your graphics card and chipset drivers, and see if this is causing your game to freeze.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your drivers automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

4. Restart your computer and check if your game now works properly. If it doesn’t, contact Driver Easy’s support team at**<support@drivereasy.com>** for further assistance. They’d be happy to help you. Or you can move on to the next method.

### Method 3: Clear your temp files

 If your system doesn’t have enough space to store temp files, it may slow down or freeze. To see if this is the cause of your problem:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**temp** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa66889b860.png)
3. **Select** all files in the Temp folder and**delete** them.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa66cf0cc78.jpg)
4. Relaunch your game and check if your problem is resolved. If not, try Method 4, below.

### Method 4: Run a memory check

 A faulty memory card is also known to cause a computer to freeze. To see if this is causing your problem, you should run a memory check:

1. Type **mdsched.exe** in the Run box and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa67ec5aba2.png)
2. If you want to run the check immediately, click**Restart now and check for problems (recommended)** . If you want to check later, click**Check for Problems the next time I start my computer** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa67cd8214e.jpg)
3. When Windows restarts, this screen will appear showing the progress of the check and the number of passes it’ll run on your memory card.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa89992510a.jpg)  
 If you don’t see any errors, your memory card probably isn’t causing your problem, and you can move on to Method 5, below.

### Method 5: Adjust the size of your virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It’s a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when you’re playing a game, your system will dip into virtual memory to save files temporarily.

 If the size of your virtual memory is not big enough to save temporary files, it may cause your computer to freeze. You can follow the steps below to adjust the size of your virtual memory and see if this is causing your problem.

1. Press the**Windows** key and**Pause** /**Break** key at the same time. Then click**Advanced System Settings** on the left.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa6b4c54aa9.jpg)
2. Click the**Advanced** tab, then click the**Settings** button in the Performance section.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa6db7a7b90.jpg)
3. From the**Advanced** tab, click**Change…**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa6e0a6f204.jpg)
4. De-select**Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa6e4d0df27.jpg)
5. **Select** your system drive ( the hard drive or partition where you installed your system — usually**C:** ), and select**Custom size** , enter the**Initial size** and**Maximum size** for your virtual memory. Click**Set** , then**OK** .  

   * **Initial size** — This value varies, depending on your computer. If you’re not sure what value to use, enter the**Recommended** size.  
   * **Maximum size** — Don’t set this value too high. It should be about**1.5 times** the size of your physical RAM. For example, a computer with 4 GB (4096 MB) of RAM should have no more than about 6,144 MB virtual memory (4,096 MB x 1.5).  
   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa72695eb05.jpg)
6. Restart your game and check if your problem is resolved. If not, try Method 6, below.

### Method 6: Run System File Checker

 Your “computer freezes during gameplay” issue may also be caused by system file corruption. You can run System File Checker and see if there are any system files missing or corrupted. If there are any, the**sfc /scannow** command (System File Checker) will repair them.

1. **Run** Command Prompt **as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa7486e289d.jpg)
2. Type **sfc /scannow** and press **Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfa7493ccb0a.jpg)
3. It should begin running a system scan and will take some time. When it finishes, restart your computer and check if it has fixed your problem. If not, try the next method.

### Method 7: Check for viruses and malware

 It may be that a virus or other malware is causing your computer to freeze when you’re playing a game. To see if this is the cause of your problem, you should run a virus scan with your antivirus program.
