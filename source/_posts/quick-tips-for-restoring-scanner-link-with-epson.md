### Fix 3: Update your network card driver

 This problem could be also due to an old network card driver.  You can update your network card driver manually or, if you’re not confident playing around with drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
