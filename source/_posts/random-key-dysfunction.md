## Fix 2: Update your keyboard driver

 An outdated or a faulty keyboard driver can also resulting in keyboard issues like this. It’s essential that you have the latest correct keyboard driver at all times.

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact keyboard, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
