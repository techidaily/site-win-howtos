In other rare cases, you can change your computer settings to get it enabled again. Read on and see how you can fix the Local Security Authority Protection being off problem.

## 2\. Modify Registry Editor

 If you’re still seeing the Local Security Authority protection off message even when you’ve turned it ON, please do the following to modify your Registry Editor:

 Incorrectly modifying Registry Editor files could cause severe computer problems, so please make sure that you always create a backup or a restore point for your computer first before you change anything in the Registry Editor.

1. Firstly, create a system restore point as instructed here:[How to enable and create restore points in Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (the screenshots here are from Windows 10, but the instructions work on Windows 11 as well).
2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key together. Type**regedit** and hit**Enter** .
