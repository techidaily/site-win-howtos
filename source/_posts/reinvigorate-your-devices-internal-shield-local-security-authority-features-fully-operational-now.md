In other rare cases, you can change your computer settings to get it enabled again. Read on and see how you can fix the Local Security Authority Protection being off problem.

## 2\. Modify Registry Editor

 If you’re still seeing the Local Security Authority protection off message even when you’ve turned it ON, please do the following to modify your Registry Editor:

 Incorrectly modifying Registry Editor files could cause severe computer problems, so please make sure that you always create a backup or a restore point for your computer first before you change anything in the Registry Editor.

1. Firstly, create a system restore point as instructed here:[How to enable and create restore points in Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (the screenshots here are from Windows 10, but the instructions work on Windows 11 as well).
2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key together. Type**regedit** and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-27.png)
3. Go to the following location:`**Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa**`  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-26.png)
4. On the right side, if you can see **RunAsPPL** , double-click it and change the**Value data** to**2** . Repeat the same with**RunAsPPLBoot** . If you don’t see either of these entries, move on to the next step.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-29.png)
