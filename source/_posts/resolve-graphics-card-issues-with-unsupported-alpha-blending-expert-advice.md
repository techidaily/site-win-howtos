1. On your keyboard, press  **the Windows logo key**  and   **R** at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc**  into the box and click  **OK**  .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5afb9c1b96ba9.png)
2. Locate and double-click on **Display adapters**  (aka. **graphics card** , **video card** ) to expand it.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b42e2baf0279.jpg)
3. Click the**Driver** tab >**Roll Back Driver** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b42e27a083b7.jpg)
4. Click**Yes** if asked for confirmation. Then the driver will be restored to a previous version.
5. Restart you computer and see if**Miracast** works properly on your computer.

### Fix 2: Insert a **Miracast adapter**

It’s also possible that the device you’re streaming content to doesn’t support Miracast. But don’t worry – if that’s the case, you need to do to enable Miracast is to plug in a Miracast adapter, such as a[Microsoft Wireless Display adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Wireless-Display-Adapter-P3Q-00001/dp/B01AZC3J3M/ref=sr%5F1%5F1%5Fsspa?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1542013017&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=Microsoft+Wireless+Display+Adapter&psc=1&tag=drivereasycom-20), into an HDMI port on your display device.
