 If you are seeing an**access denied** file or folder error on your Windows system, you are not alone. Many Windows users have got it. This usually occurs when they are accessing or making changes to a file or folder. Sometimes the error appears when upgrading from a previous version of Windows.

## Method 1: Take the ownership of the file or folder

 The access denied error may occur if you don’t have the ownership of the file or folder or the ownership has changed. You can try taking the ownership and see if this resolves the problem.

 Note that the steps to take the ownership on Windows 10/8 is slightly different from the steps on Windows 7\. The following part will show you how to take ownership on the these different systems.

**IMPORTANT:**  You should log on your operating system as an administrator before you go on — An administrator has the privileges to make advanced changes to the file or folder and the steps as follows require those privileges.

 If you are not clear if your account type is administrator, click the**Start** button in the lower left corner of the screen and then type “_**account**_ “.

## Method 3: Recover your data

 It is also possible that you get the access denied error because the file or folder you are accessing is corrupted. You can’t open it or make any changes. Honestly, in most cases, the corrupted files and folders cannot be repaired. You can only either delete it or recover it from a backup copy. But still you can utilize some data recovery tools or services to recover data from a corrupted folder. So if the data in the problem folder is important for you, you can try using find some programs or services to perform data recovery in order to save them.
