## Razer Keyboard Not Glowing: Common Issues and Fixes Discovered

If you have a razer keyboard which has many lights on and meant to lighten up, but it stops working, you might be frustrated. Don’t worry, you’re not alone and you’ve come to the right place! The fixes here can solve this problem.

## Try these fixes

1. [**Plug your keyboard in another USB port**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Uninstall and reinstall Razer Synapse**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Plug your keyboard in another USB port

 It’s probably caused by the poor connection. Plug your keyboard into another USB port and check if it does light up. If it does and everything works well, it’s your USB port that has the issue.  
 If it doesn’t light up, move to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Uninstall and reinstall Razer Synapse

 Plug your keyboard into another computer to see it light up or not. If it doesn’t light up, it might be a hardware problem and you need to contact Razer support.  
 If it does, the problem might be caused by your Razer Synapse. Then a full reinstall of Synapse can help you solve the problem.

1. Unplug your keyboard.
2. Uninstall Synapse.
3. Press**Windows key + R** together to open the Run box.
4. Type “service.msc” and press**Enter** to open Windows Services. Make sure all Razer services listed are stopped.

5. Go to C:\\Users\\Your user name\\AppData and delete any Razer folders.
6. Go to C:\\Program Files (x86)… or wherever you installed Synapse and delete the Razer folders.
7. Reboot your computer.
8. Go to the[Razer official website](https://www.razer.com/synapse-3) to download the latest version of Synapse.
9. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Synapse.
10. Launch Synapse.
11. Plug your keyboard and check the lightening.

### Fix 3: Update your driver
