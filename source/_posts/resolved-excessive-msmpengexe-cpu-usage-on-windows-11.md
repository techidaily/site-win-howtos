## Resolving: Windows 10/11, Non-Responsive Acer Laptop Keys

 Many Acer laptop users have reported that the keyboard on their laptop can’t work properly – sometimes it’s just some of the keys that are not responsive, and for others the keyboard itself stops functioning altogether.

 This is a very annoying problem – and quite scary. You’re probably thinking, “I can’t even use my laptop without a keyboard! How am I supposed to fix a problem like this without one?”

 But don’t worry! It’s possible to fix this problem – even without your keyboard. Here are four fixes you should try:

 **Method 1: [Completely reboot your laptop](#a)**
 **Method 2: [Disable Filter Keys](#b)**
 **Method 3:[Update your keyboard driver](#c)**
 **Method 4: [Troubleshoot the hardware issues](#d)**

## Method 1: Completely reboot your laptop

 The simplest fix to your keyboard issue is to reboot your Acer laptop completely. To do so:

1. Press and**hold** the**power button** of your laptop until the laptop is totally off.
2. Unplug the**power cable** and the **battery** from your laptop.
3. Leave your laptop for a few seconds
4. Plug the power cable and the battery back into your laptop.
5. Power on your computer. Then check to see if this fixes your keyboard.

## Method 2: Disable Filter Keys

**Filter Keys** is a feature that makes your keyboard ignore brief or repeated keystrokes. It sometimes leads to the issue of the laptop keyboard not working. You can try**disabling Filter Keys** to sort this issue out.

### Windows 10

1. Click the Start menu (the Windows logo) at the bottom left of your screen. Then click **Settings** .

## Method 4: Troubleshoot the hardware issues

 It is also possible that there are hardware problems with your Acer laptop keyboard. You can troubleshoot problems of this kind on your own or ask an expert for help.

 Your laptop keyboard may not receive proper pressure on itself. You may need to remove the cover of your laptop, and then use a screwdriver to**adjust the screws** inside the laptop. This may do the trick.

 Or you can just leave hardware issues to an expert. If your Acer laptop is still under warranty, it is recommended that you**contact Acer support** to have your keyboard repaired or your laptop replaced.
