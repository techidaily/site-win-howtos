## Fix 1 – Is it a driver issue?

Depending on different situations, you may encounter the **Unable to Contact DHCP Server** error when your network driver is outdated or new and problematic (hence requiring a rollback). There are ways you can do it manually, but if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**
