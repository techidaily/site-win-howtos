### **Fix 2: Install the latest game patch**

 The developers of**Nier Automata** will keep releasing game patches to fix bugs. You can install the latest patch which may have triggered this issue.

 After installing the latest game patch, run Nier Automata to see if the issue has been resolved. If this issue still there, or there’s no new game patch released, move to the next fix.

### **Fix 3: Update or reinstall your drivers**

#### A. Update your driver

 Missing or outdated drivers may also trigger the game crash issues. In this case, you need to update your drivers to resolve this issue.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**automatically** and**manually** .

**Option 1–Automatically**

 Use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to automatically update your driver with 2 clicks (  
 This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ) :

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and **R** together to invoke the Run box.

### **Fix 4: Close FAR(Fix Automata Resolution) Mod**

 Fix Automata Resolution (FAR) is developed by Nier Automata. By manipulating the graphics requirements of the game, users with lower specs can play the game. But FAR can be the reason for the Nier Automata crashing problem.

 If you have already enabled FAR mod, you can disable it and restore the game settings to default to solve the problem. Then restart your computer to check whether it solves the problem or not.
