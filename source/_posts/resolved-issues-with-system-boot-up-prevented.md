 **5\. Change Power Management Setting**

 The Power Management would also be the reason causing the USB problem. Windows is set to shut down your USB controller to save power by default, sometimes it won’t be able to power it back up. So try following steps to prevent Windows from “managing” power to your USB controller or the devices.

Follow below steps.

1. In Device Manager, under category “Universal Serial Bus controllers”,  
 Double-click the “USB Root Hub” device, and go to the **Power Management**  tab. (if there’s more than one USB Root Hub device, repeat these steps for each one.)

2\. Turn off the **Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power** option, and click **OK** .
