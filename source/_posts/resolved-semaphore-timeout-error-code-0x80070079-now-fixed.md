   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Snap839-1.png)  
    It may take several minutes for this command operation to be completed.

   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Snap840-1.png)  
    It may take several minutes for this command operation to be completed.  
   3. **Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth**  
    The command line **Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth** tells the DISM tool to try to repair the corrupted files detected. It will replace the corrupted files with the files from official source online.  
   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Snap841-1.png)  
    It may take several minutes for this command operation to be completed.
