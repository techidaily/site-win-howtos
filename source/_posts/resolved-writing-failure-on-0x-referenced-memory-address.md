### Fix 2: Update graphics card driver

 The missing or outdated graphics card driver can cause the**Failed to initialize unity graphics** error, so you should update your graphics card driver to the latest version to fix the issue.

 If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you will get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ).
