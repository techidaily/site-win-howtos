4. See if the system interrupts still consume a high CPU usage on your computer.

## Solution 5: Repair system files

 If you are facing persistent issues and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it’s possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that   **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones. By scanning your PC comprehensively, Fortect can provide a more comprehensive and effective solution for repairing your Windows system.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you**a detailed report of your PC status** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-scan.jpg)
3. Once finished, you’ll see a report showing all the issues. To fix all the issues automatically, click**Start Repair** (You’ll need to purchase the full version. It comes with a**60-day Money-Back Guarantee** so you can refund anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem).

## Solution 6: Consider a system reset

 If none of the above helps to fix the high CPU usage problem trigger by System interrupts, you may need to consider a Windows reset: it wipes out all software incompatibilities and problems, it’s also the rule of thumb in telling a software problem from a hardware one: if the problem remains even after a system reset, then it’s definitely a hardware problem.
