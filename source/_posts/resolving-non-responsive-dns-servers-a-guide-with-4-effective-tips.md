### Fix 1: Update your Bluetooth driver

 Bluetooth needs the supporting hardware and software to work. When you’re sure your computer is Bluetooth capable but you somehow can’t use it, the most likely cause is a Bluetooth driver problem.

Fortunately, this is also the easiest problem to fix.

 There are two ways to update your Bluetooth driver —**manually** or**automatically** .

**Update your Bluetooth driver manually** — You can update your Bluetooth driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your Bluetooth. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

**Update your Bluetooth driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bb6f71081f36.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. )

4. Restart your computer and check if you can turn on Bluetooth now. If you can’t, contact Driver Easy’s support team at**<support@drivereasy.com>** for further assistance. They’d be happy to help you. Or you can move on to Fix 2, below.

### Fix 2: Re-enable the Bluetooth driver software in Device Manager

1. Click the**Start** button, type**device manager** in the search box, and select the matching result.

2. Expand the**Bluetooth Radios** category. You’ll see the Bluetooth hardware listed there.

 If you don’t see the “Bluetooth Radios” category, find your Bluetooth adapter in the “Network adapters” category. It normally contains your network card that you use to connect to wireless or wired networks.

 If there is a yellow exclamation mark on the Bluetooth icon, you need to install the proper driver before the Bluetooth will work. See[How to install or update the latest Bluetooth driver as mentioned in Fix 1](#fix1) .

 3) Right-click on your Bluetooth device and select **Disable** .
