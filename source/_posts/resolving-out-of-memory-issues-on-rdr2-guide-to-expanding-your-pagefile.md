## Why does the error occur to my browser?

 When connecting securely, websites needs to provide a certificate issued from the certificate authority to ensure that it’s connected to the target website and the connection is encrypted. If you see “SEC\_ERROR\_UNKNOWN\_ISSUER” when opening a website, it means that Firefox default connection is not trusted as the certificate is unknown.

 It’s actually browser or the website’s responsibility to detect or provide the secure certificate issue. However, if there’s malware or virus in your computer, you’re likely to run into this error as well.

So don’t give up hope. There is something you can do to fix it.

## Try these fixes

 Here are solutions to try. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until it works.

1. [Run a virus scan](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Create a new user profile](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Disable SSL scanning in your antivirus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Run a virus scan

 The ‘SEC\_ERROR\_UNKNOWN\_ISSUER’ error message may appear if a virus on your computer is preventing the certificate from being detected. The virus may even be generating the error itself.

 So run a virus scan across your entire Windows system. Yes, it will take some time to complete, but it’s worth it. Unfortunately, Windows Defender may not detect it, so it’s worth trying another antivirus application such as Avira and Panda.

 If any malware has been detected, follow the instructions provided by the antivirus program to fix it.

 Then restart your computer and try to open the website again to see if it works.

### Fix 2: Create a new user profile

 You can also create a new user profile in Firefox to fix the error SEC\_ERROR\_UNKNOWN\_ISSUER.

To do so, follow the steps below:

1. If Firefox is open click the**menu button** and click**Exit** to close Firefox.  
 If Firefox in your computer is already closed, head to the next step.

3. Type**firefox.exe -P** and click**OK** .

6. Re-launch Firefox and log in your new user profile.
7. Open the website again to see if your problem has been fixed.

### Fix 3: Disable SSL scanning in your antivirus software

 Sometimes your antivirus program prevents your computer from visiting the websites without certificate issuer. If you want to open the website that’s giving you the SEC\_ERROR\_UNKNOWN\_ISSUER error, you’ll need to disable SSL scanning in your antivirus program.

 Since there are many antivirus programs, the specific steps can be different. So we take Avast here as an example.

1. Open Avast in your computer, and click**Menu** \>**Settings** on the upper right.

2. Click**Components** on the left, and click**Customize** in the**Web Shield** section.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c1200c760b7e.jpg)
3. Uncheck the box next to**Enable HTTPS scanning** in the pop-up window. Then click**OK** .
