## Solution 1: Update the bluetooth driver

 The Bluetooth missing problem is probably being caused by driver issues. To fix the problem, you can try to update the Bluetooth driver.

 There are two ways you can update your Bluetooth driver: manually and automatically.

**Way 1 — Manually:**  You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your devices, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows versions. In this way, you will need to check the updates for your devices one by one.

**Way 2 — Automatically:**  If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find all the available correct drivers, and it will download and install them correctly :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy. Then run it on your Windows.

 2) Click **Scan Now** . All driver problems of your computer would be detected in less than 1 minute. Your Bluetooth driver is no exception.

 3) If you try the Free version, click **Update**  next to your flagged Bluetooth driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.

 Or if you use the Pro version, click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of **_all_** the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (You get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee for the Pro version)

4) After updating the driver, check to see if the problem is resolved.

## Solution 2: Check for the Bluetooth Support service

 Bluetooth Support service supports the discovery and association of Bluetooth devices. If it’s disabled, your Bluetooth device won’t work properly due to Bluetooth missing in Device Manager. So check for the Bluetooth Support service and make sure it’s started. If it’s disabled, start it manually.

Follow these steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Win+R** (Windows key and R key) at the same time to invoke the run box.

 2) Type **services.msc** and press**Enter** on your keyboard.

 3) Double-click the**Bluetooth Support Service** .
