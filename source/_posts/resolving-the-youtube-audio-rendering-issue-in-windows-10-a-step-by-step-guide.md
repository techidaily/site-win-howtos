## What is USB tethering?

 You can share your phone’s mobile data with another device, like your laptop, through **tethering** . It makes your laptop be able to connect to the Internet when there’s no network connection. There are three types of tethering:**USB tethering** ,**Wi-Fi tethering** ,**Bluetooth tethering** .

 USB tethering has the fastest speed among the three ones. It requires a USB cable to connect your laptop with your phone. But at the same time, it makes your phone suck power from your laptop’s USB port instead of draining.
