### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Corrupted or outdated graphics drivers may trigger Error 0x887A0006\. To fix this issue, you need to update your graphics driver to the latest version. Updating your graphics driver to the latest version can make your game run smoother and prevent many issues or errors.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your graphics card: manually or**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 A**utomatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
