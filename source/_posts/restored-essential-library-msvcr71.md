### Fix 2: Update your device drivers

 Device drivers, which act as a translator between your hardware components and your computer system, are essential for the proper functioning of your computer. A wrong, outdated or corrupt driver may cause instability or even crashes to your system. So you should update your drivers to see if it fixes your problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/last-scan-never.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
![Update drivers with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Update-drivers-with-Driver-Easy.jpg)  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
5. Launch Total War: ROME REMASTERED and check to see if crashing issue has been resolved. If yes, then great! If the issue persists, please try **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: Run Steam as administrator

 Total War: ROME REMASTERED requires administrator privileges in order to access protected system resources. If the game or the game client doesn’t have the required permissions, you may encounter crash. So you should make sure to runSteam as administrator to see if it fixes the issue.

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and type **epic** , then right-click on **Steam**  and click **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/123-1.png)
2. Click **Yes**  when UAC promots for permissions to proceed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After that, launch Total War: ROME REMASTERED game and see if the crashing problem still occurs. If it doesn’t, then great! If the issue persists, please try **Fix 4** , below.

### Fix 4: Verify game files on Steam

 The game may crash if the files are faulty or corrupt. Luckily, Steam has built the repair feature into the launcher itself, allowing you to fix little glitches on your own.

 You can verify the integrity of the game files to compare the files on your PC to the ones on Steam servers. If any files are found different, they may be changed or repaired. Here are the steps:

1. Restart your computer.
2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to **LIBRARY** , then right click on Total War: ROME REMASTERED game title and click **Properties…** .
4. Click **LOCAL FILES** \> **Verify integrity of game files…** .
5. Wait a few minutes for Steam to validate the files of the game. Again, any files found missing or corrupt would be automatically downloaded in the process.
6. Re-launch Total War: ROME REMASTERED to see if it can be played properly. If yes, then congrats! If it’s still no joy, please try **Fix 5** , below.

### Fix 5: Allow Steam through firewall

 A firewall is a network security system that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic by permitting/blocking specific traffic based on a set of security rules. You should allow Steam client through the firewall to make sure that the connection isn’t lost.

 To make sure you allow the app to communicate through Windows Defender Firewall:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then type **control firewall.cpl**  into the box and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/run-1-1.png)
2. In the window that pops up, click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Allow-an-app-or-feature-through-Windows-Defender-Firewall-1.png)
3. Browse through the list of Allowed apps and features to see if Steam is included. If not, click **Change settings** , click **Allow another app…** , then follow the on-screen instructions to add the app.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Change-settings-Allow-another-app-1.png)
4. Once completed, click **OK** .
5. Run the game in the client and see if it still crashes. If it’s still on-going, please move on to **Fix 6** .

 If you have anti-virus software running in your computer, make sure you disable it temporarily too. During this time, be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download.

### Fix 6: Install the latest patch

 The crashing issue could be a bug ensconced in the patches of the game. If this is the case, the developers would respond to this and address the issue with a new patch. So you can check out the latest patch to see if it helps fix the issue.

 If there’s no new patch available, or the problem remains after installing the latest patch, head on to **Fix 7** , below.

### Fix 7: Perform a clean boot

 Another possible cause for the Total War: ROME REMASTERED crashing issue is software conflict. If this is the case, you should perform a clean boot. A clean boot restarts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, allowing you to narrow down the programs and servicies so that you could potentially pinpoint the offender.

Here are the steps to perform a clean boot:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to bring up the Run box. Type or past **msconfig**  and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/msconfig-1.png)
2. Click the **Services**  tab and tick the box for **Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/service-and-hide-all-microsoft-services-1.png)
3. Browse through the full list of services, make sure to   **check the boxes for the items that belong to your hardware manufacturers**  (such as Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm) and **uncheck the boxes for the rest** . Once finished, click **OK** to apply the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/esential.png)
4. Restart your computer, then test to see if the game still crashes.  

   * **If Total War: ROME REMASTERED stops crashing** , you can try repeating these steps, disabling half of the services each time until you isolate the culpable program. Once you do, do some research on the internet to find out what the program is for, then contact the vendor of this program for advice or an alternative solution.  
   * **If Total War: ROME REMASTERED still crashes** , please continue to **Fix 8** .

### Fix 8:**Reinstall Total War: ROME REMASTERED and Steam**

 If you’ve exhausted the fixes above but the issue still sticks around, then you should perhaps reinstall the game and Steam client to see if you could fix the problem.
