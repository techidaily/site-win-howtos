### Fix 1: Run PUBG in windowed full screen

 Running PUBG in windowed full screen is a proven effective way to reduce lag. To do so:

 While in PUBG, press**Alt** and**Enter** at the same time.

 Once youâ€™re in windowed full screen mode, check if the lag issues have reduced. If yes, then great! If the lag issues remain, please move on to**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Close unused apps and set high priority for PUBG

 Closing unused apps would probably be most peopleâ€™s knee-jerk reaction to a laggy and unresponsive computer. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**   and **Esc**   at the same time to open **Task Manager** .
2. Right-click on the programs you donâ€™t need to run at the moment and click **End task** .

### Fix 3: Lower your game resolution

Running PUBG in a lower resolution can also help in fixing lag:

1. Create a shortcut of your PUBG, then right-click on the**shortcut** and click**Properties** .
2. Under the **Shortcut** tab, in **Target** field, leave**a space** and type**resolution:** **the resolution of your preference** (1024Ã—768 for example).

### Fix 4: Update your graphics drivers

 The PUBG lag problem may also occur if youâ€™re using the wrong or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes your problem. If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but itâ€™s partly manual.

4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

5) Start a new game in PUBG to see if the PUBG lap problem has been resolved. If yes, then congrats! But if the issue persists, please move on to**Fix 5** , below.

### Fix 5: Change the power option and adjust for best performance

 By default, the power plan on our computer is often configured to **Balanced**   or **Power saver**   to conserve battery, which largely compromises the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU.

 Also the system performance on our computer may also be undermined for the advanced graphics features.

So to tweak the settings:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **R**   at the same time, then copy & paste **powercfg.cpl**   into the box and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c4e6c91572.png)
2. Choose the **High performance** option.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c4f0b203f9.jpg)
3. In the top-right corner of the window, type **advanced**  and click **View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c503626f65.jpg)
4. Click **Adjust for best performance** \> **Apply** \> **OK** .
