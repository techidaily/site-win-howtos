1. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**   and **Esc**   at the same time to open **Task Manager** .
2. Right-click on the programs you donâ€™t need to run at the moment and click **End task** .

### Fix 4: Update your graphics drivers

 The PUBG lag problem may also occur if youâ€™re using the wrong or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes your problem.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

### Fix 5: Change the power option and adjust for best performance

 By default, the power plan on our computer is often configured to **Balanced**   or **Power saver**   to conserve battery, which largely compromises the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU.

 Also the system performance on our computer may also be undermined for the advanced graphics features.

So to tweak the settings:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **R**   at the same time, then copy & paste **powercfg.cpl**   into the box and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c4e6c91572.png)
2. Choose the **High performance** option.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c4f0b203f9.jpg)
3. In the top-right corner of the window, type **advanced**  and click **View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c503626f65.jpg)
4. Click **Adjust for best performance** \> **Apply** \> **OK** .
