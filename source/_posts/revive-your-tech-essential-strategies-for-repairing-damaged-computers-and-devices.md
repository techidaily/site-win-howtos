## Hard Reset

 If you’re experiencing unexpectable behavior like one functional key is not working or keyboard lighting issues, after trying a soft reset on your computer, you may want to try a hard reset.

 Different brands of the keyboard will provide you different ways to do a hard reset. You’d better go to your keyboard’s manufacturer’s official website and ask for help. Here we provide you a general keyboard hard reset guide:

1. Unplug your keyboard and wait for 30 seconds.
2. Hold the ESC key on your keyboard and plug it back to your computer.
3. Press the ESC key till you see the keyboard is flashing.

Your keyboard should be reset successfully.
