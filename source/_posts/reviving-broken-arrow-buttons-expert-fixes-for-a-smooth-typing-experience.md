1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog. Type**cmd**  and then press **Ctrl** , **Shift** , and **Enter**  on your keyboard at the same time to **run the Command Prompt as administrator** . You will be prompted for permission.

**Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth**  
![DISM ScanHealth](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DISM-ScanHealth.jpg)  
**Note:** When you run the command mentioned above, the DISM tool will scan all the system files and compare them with official system files. The function of this command line is to see if the system file on your PC is consistent with its official source or not. This command line doesn’t fix the corruption.  

**Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth**  
![DISM CheckHealth](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DISM-CheckHealth.jpg)  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Note:** When you run the command line **Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth** , the DISM tool will check whether your Windows 10 image exists corruptions or not. This command line also doesn’t repair the corrupted files.  

**Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth**  
![DISM RestoreHealth](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DISM-RestoreHealth.jpg)  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Note: The command line **Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth** tells the DISM tool to try to repair the corrupted files detected. It will replace the corrupted files with the files from official source online.
3. Close Command Prompt when the restore operation completed.  
![Fix 4 step 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Fix-4-step-3.jpg)

 See if you can perform a Windows update. If this issue persists, try running the System File Checker.

### Fix 5: Run System File Checker

**System File Checker** can scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. When you fail to install Windows updates, it may be caused by some corruption error. In this case, running System File Checker may help you resolve this issue.

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key** and then type **cmd** in the search box. When you see **Command Prompt** in the list of results, right-click it and then select **Run as administrator** . You will be prompted for permission. Click **OK** to run **Command Prompt** .  
![Fix 5 step 1](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Fix-5-step-1.jpg)

**sfc /scannow**  
![sfc sacannow](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sfc-sacannow.jpg)
3. When this command operation is completed, close the Command Prompt.

 Run Windows Update again to check whether this fix works or not. If you still fail to install updates for your Windows system, please try the next fix.

### Fix 6: Download updates from Microsoft Update Catalog manually

 If all the fixes above don’t work for you, you can try downloading the updates you failed to install from **[Microsoft Update Catalog](http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/home.aspx)**  and install them manually.

 Before downloading Windows updates manually, you need to know the system type of your Windows OS. You can follow the steps below to view the system type information:
