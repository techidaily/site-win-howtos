### Fix 1: Check for physical issues

Depending on which mouse isn’t working:

* If it’s the touchpad mouse, then move on to**Fix 2** .
* If it’s the external mouse, then try a different port, a different functioning mouse, and replace/recharge the battery (if it has one) to see if this fixes the problem. If not, move on to**Fix 2** .

---

### Fix 2: Try the function keys

 Sometimes the mouse-isn’t-moving issue happens just because you’ve pressed the function keys and disabled trackpad unknowingly. If that’s the case, we might have to press the keys again to turn it back on. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, hold down**the Fn key** and press**the touchpad key** (or**F7** ,**F8** ,**F9** ,**F5** , depending on the laptop brand you’re using).
2. Move your mouse and check if the **mouse frozen on laptop** issue has been fixed. If yes, then great! But if the problem persists, move on to**Fix 3** , below.

---

### Fix 3: **Check mouse properties**

 Another possible cause for this mouse-got-stuck problem is trackpad is turned off. To get your mouse unstuck:

1. On your keyboard, press **the**   **Windows logo key**  , then copy & paste **main.cpl** into the box and click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b3dbcd41adbc.png)
2. Click the **Device Settings** tab > **your device** \> **Enable** \> **Apply** \> **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b3dbdfd5f66f.jpg)
3. Hopefully this time your mouse gets unfrozen and works fine. If the problem persists, try **Fix 4** .

---

### Fix 4: **Update your device drivers**
