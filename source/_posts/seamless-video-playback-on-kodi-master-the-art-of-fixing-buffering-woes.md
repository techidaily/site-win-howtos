## Fixes for Kodi Buffering Issue

1. [Stop Kodi buffering issue with a VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Adjust video cache size with One nation](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Clear Kodi cache with One nation](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Stop Kodi buffering issue with a VPN

 Most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) make a promise to users about their unlimited, high-speed internet services. While if you are an average user you will have a good internet speed. But if you’re a heavy streamer, you would be affected by bandwidth throttling.

 Even if you are an average user, you may meet Kodi buffering issue while watching live TV streams. The buffering you encounter from live TV add-ons are caused by server overload of the corresponding add-ons.

 The two situations can be fixed with one method–get a good VPN (Virtual Private Network). Through VPN, your ISP doesn’t know what you are streaming. VPN can lead you directly to the server without passing by the ISP to reduce the speed loss and avoid the restrictions. Using a VPN helps you in securing your privacy as well.

 You can use the VPN you already have, if you don’t have one, it’s recommended to use[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) can bypass geo-restrictions to get all add-ons desired, keeps you protected from snooping eyes, and secures your data to keep your online activity private. It’s safe and easy to use!  

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  NordVPN in your device. (You can get 75% OFF right now!)

### Fix 2: Adjust video cache size with One nation

### Fix 3: Clear Kodi cache with One nation

 Besides expanding the cache size, you can use clearing Kodi cache to fix the issue. The cache is like a reservoir, the temp files are like rocks in the reservoir. When the reservoir is filled with the stream you need, you’ll get constantly fluent streaming. But if there’s rock inside, the stream will slow down and you’ll encounter the Kodi buffering issue. So, clearing cache to leave more space can fix the Kodi buffering problem.

1. Select Add-ons in the Kodi home screen and click**One Nation Portal** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/j5-2.jpg)
