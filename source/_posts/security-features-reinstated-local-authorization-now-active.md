Local Security Authority Protection is off

 No need to worry if your Local Security Authority Protection is toggled off: in most cases, it was a UI bug with a certain Windows update patch, meaning that it’s not off, just appears to be off, and you can install another update patch to get it fixed. In other rare cases, you can change your computer settings to get it enabled again. Read on and see how you can fix the Local Security Authority Protection being off problem.

## Try these fixes to enable the Local Security Authority Protection

 As mentioned, in most cases, your Local Security Authority is off because of a UI bug with a Windows patch, so the first method should be enough to help. If it doesn’t, please move on to methods 2 and 3.

1. **[Install Windows Update patch KB5007651](#m1)**
2. **[Modify Registry Editor](#m2)**
3. **[Configure Group Policy Editor](#m3)**

## 2\. Modify Registry Editor

 If you’re still seeing the Local Security Authority protection off message even when you’ve turned it ON, please do the following to modify your Registry Editor:

 Incorrectly modifying Registry Editor files could cause severe computer problems, so please make sure that you always create a backup or a restore point for your computer first before you change anything in the Registry Editor.

1. Firstly, create a system restore point as instructed here:[How to enable and create restore points in Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (the screenshots here are from Windows 10, but the instructions work on Windows 11 as well).
2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key together. Type**regedit** and hit**Enter** .
