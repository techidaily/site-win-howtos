## Why does the error Failed to initialize renderer occur?

Rendering or image synthesis is the automatic process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D by means of computer programs, and the result of the displaying such a model can be called a render. When launching the game, the game engine would check your video card details, and see what it is capable of supporting. After that, the game engine decides what things to initialize for it. If it fails, it means that the game can not read your video card properly. So it’s probably due to the**graphics card driver problem**.

### **Solutions 4: Validating master files for your game**

It’s likely that your graphics settings are high, or your files are set as read only, so it prevents your game from updating your graphics settings. You can try validating master files for your game to fix it. 1) Close the game and Steam, then go to Steam folder and remove folder named **appcache**  . Steam will create a new folder later later when you open it, please don’t worry.2) Go to the folder of the game that gives the error. It’s normally in**C drive > Users> Your Name > Documents > My games**, or in**Documents > My games**, then click the file that is named with the game. For example, if it’s Skyrim that gives the error of Failed to initialize renderer, you can open the file named Skyrim in Document > My games > Skyrim.
