## Solution 1: Turn off the Sticky Keys and the Filter Keys feature

 Sticky Keys and Filter keys are two accessibility functions in the Windows operating system. Sticky Keys allows you to press one key at a time for keyboard shortcuts; Filter Keys tells the keyboard to ignore your brief or repeated keystrokes. If these two keyboard functions are enabled, sometimes your backspace key cannot work fine.

 Follow these steps to turn off these two features to get your backspace to work again:

#### Window 10

 1) Type**ease** in the search box from Start. Then click **Ease of Access keyboard settings** .

 2) Make sure the status of Sticky Keys and Filter Keys are all set to **Off** . If you see **On** , switch to **Off** .

#### Windows 11

1. Press the **Windows logo key**  and **R**  simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Select**Accessibility** on the left panel, then scroll down the list on the right and click**Keyboard** under the Interaction section.

 Your backspace key should work now. Check to see if it works. If unfortunately not, please try the next solution.

## Solution 2: Reinstall your keyboard

 The corrupted connection between your keyboard and your Windows operating system could also make the backspace key stop working. You can reinstall your keyboard to solve it.

 The screenshots shown below are from Windows 10, but the solutions apply to other versions of Windows.

Follow these:

 1) On your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/win-key-1.png)**  and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.
