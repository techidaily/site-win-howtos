## Method 1: Change memory allocation

 The “Skyrim infinite loading screen” error probably can be caused by memory shortage. So you can configure the SafetyLoad config file to set Safy Load to work while on the loading screen. The default setting allows it to run all of the time, and this can cause infinite loading screen issues or crashing issues.  

 You can follow the below steps to change the settings:  

 Before you move on, ensure you’ve installed SKSE (Skyrim Script Extender). If you don’t have installed it yet, you can install it from the[Steam SKSE page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/365720/Skyrim%5FScript%5FExtender%5FSKSE/) .  

 1) Open the file “Skyrim\\data\\SKSE\\Plugins\\**SafetyLoad.ini** ”.

 2)**Change the value** of**EnableOnlyLoading** from false to**true** .

 3)**Save** and close the file.

 4) Play Skyrim and see if the infinite loading screen issue is resolved.  

## Method 2: Update the drivers

 Faulty drivers can cause infinite loading screen errors. To fix the problem, you can try to update the drivers. Updated drivers can improve game performance.  

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

## Method 3: Uninstall mods

 Many mods or mod conflicts can be the cause of infinite loading screen errors. If you don’t have any mods, try Method 3\. But **if you’ve installed multiple mods, you can uninstall them one by one** .  

 After uninstalling one mod, play Skyrim and see if the problem persists. If the problem is gone, it means that mod is the cause. You may not be able to use that mod. You can check the system and the device requirements for that mod, then see if your system and devices support the mod.  

**Tip** : In case a new mod causes your game not playing issues. We recommend you not install multiple mods at one time. After you install a new mod, check to see if the game can play with no problems. If there are no problems, then you can install another new mod.
