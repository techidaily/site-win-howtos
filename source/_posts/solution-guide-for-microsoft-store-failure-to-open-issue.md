### Method 3: Update your audio driver

 The outdated or missing drivers may be the reason for the “Forza Horizon 4 no sound” problem. You can update your audio driver to solve the problem.

There are two ways you can update your audio drivers.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can go to the [Realtek](http://www.realtek.com/downloads/) [](http://www.realtek.com/downloads/) website, find the drivers for your system version and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
