### Method 4: Update your keyboard driver

 If unfortunately reinstalling your keyboard driver didn’t fix your keyboard problem, you’d better update your keyboard driver to ensure you have the correct latest one on your computer.

 You can**update your keyboard driver manually** by going to the manufacturer’s website for your keyboard and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose the only driver that’s compatible with your Windows version.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b766c7750279.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
**Note:** You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
