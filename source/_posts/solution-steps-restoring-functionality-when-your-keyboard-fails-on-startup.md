### Method 1: Restart your computer

 Your keyboard won’t type issue could happen just because your keyboard or the system that your computer is running gets stuck somehow. Once your keyboard is not working, you can restart your computer first. A simple restart can always solve computer woes.

See how to do it:

 If your computer is running**Windows 11/10** , use your mouse to click the**Start** button, then click the**power icon** and select**Restart.**

### Method 2: Adjust your keyboard settings

 There’re some easy-access keys features, like Sticky keys, to help you control your keyboard better. But you may encounter some problems including this keyboard won’t type issue when you enable one or more of these keyboard features. So when your keyboard is not working, make sure you turn off the easy access keys as this method has helped many users.

4. Once you do, restart your computer. Windows should then reinstall the driver for your keyboard automatically.

 Try to type some words using your keyboard to see if it works. If you type successfully, great! If you still aren’t able to type on your keyboard, don’t feel frustrated, move on to the next method.

### Method 4: Update your keyboard driver

 If unfortunately reinstalling your keyboard driver didn’t fix your keyboard problem, you’d better update your keyboard driver to ensure you have the correct latest one on your computer.

 You can**update your keyboard driver manually** by going to the manufacturer’s website for your keyboard and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose the only driver that’s compatible with your Windows version.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b766c7750279.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
**Note:** You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

### Method 5: Try this fix if you’re using a USB keyboard

 If unfortunately, all the fixes above fail to help you and you’re using a USB keyboard, You can try to connect the keyboard with**another USB port** to check if it works as an old, shabby USB port could cause your Keyboard not to work.

### Method 6: Try this fix if you’re using a wireless keyboard

1. Remove the**USB receiver** from the computer.
2. On the taskbar of your computer’s desktop, click the**Start button** to select the**power icon** . Then select**Shut down** .
