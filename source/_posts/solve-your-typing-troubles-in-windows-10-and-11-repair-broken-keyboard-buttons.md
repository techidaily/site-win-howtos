### Fix 1: Hard reset your keyboard

 If you’re experiencing unexpected behavior like a letter key not working on your keyboard or one functional key not working, you could try a hard reset to fix this issue.

 Different brands of the keyboard will provide you with different ways to do a hard reset. You’d better go to your keyboard manufacturer’s official website and ask for help. Here we provide you a general keyboard hard reset guide:

1. Unplug your keyboard and wait for 30 seconds.
2. Hold the**ESC** key on your keyboard and plug it back into your computer.
3. Press the ESC key till you see the keyboard flashing.

Your keyboard should be reset successfully.

If you’re a laptop user, you could follow these steps:

1. Turn off your laptop.
2. Disconnect all the**peripheral devices** (flash disk, external monitor, etc.) from your laptop.
3. Disconnect the**power cable** from your laptop.
4. Remove the**battery** from your laptop (if it’s removable).
5. Press and hold the**power button** on your laptop for 15 seconds.
6. Install the**battery** on your laptop.
7. Connect the**power cable** to your laptop.

 Now turn on your laptop and see if this fixes your laptop keyboard.  
 If the steps above didn’t help you, there’s another way you can try:

1. Check the**bottom surface** of your laptop (or your laptop manual) for a**pinhole reset button** .
2. If you find one, press that pinhole to power reset your laptop.

 Now check to see if this works for you.  
 If the keys are still not working, you could move to[Fix 2](#f2) .

### Fix 2: Check for hardware issues

 If a hard reset is not working for you, you need to identify whether it’s a hardware issue or a software issue. Follow the steps below:

 First, check your keyboard connection, USB port, and layout. Use compressed air to clean your keyboard and see if this fixes your keyboard issue.

 If cleaning the keyboard didn’t work for you, you need to[boot to BIOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  
 If your keys work fine in the BIOS, it means it’s a software issue. You should move to[Fix 3](#f3) .  
 But if not, you need to consider repair it or replace with a new one. If your keyboard is under warranty, it is recommended that you do not repair it by yourself in case the warranty expires.

### Fix 3: Update your keyboard driver

 Your letter keys may not be working properly because you’re using the wrong keyboard driver or it’s out of date. You should update your keyboard driver to see if this fixes your keyboard.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](#op1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download the driver from the manufacturer’s official website. You need to search the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your operating system. Then download and install it manually.  
 The process may take you some time and energy to find and install. So if you want to save some time, you can move to[Option 2](#op2) .

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.

## Tips: Keyboard maintenance

1. Try not to eat, smoke or drink on top of the keyboard to keep it clean.
2. Please do not keep hitting the keyboard vigorously. This will cause damage to the soft glue that supports the keyboard keys.
3. Clean the keyboard regularly. The dust in the button gap will accumulate and result in some malfunction of the keyboard if you didn’t clean the keyboard for a long time.
