## ````   **Other options**

````
````1) If you’re an advanced user, and none of the above methods work, you need to consider updating your BIOS. Please only do so when you’re fully aware of what you’re doing. Any losses is at your own peril.
````
````2) Check to see if you need to get your mouse sensor and mouse pad clean since too much dust on the optical sensor might detect false inputs and prevent your screen saver from showing up.
