### Fix 2: Set default devices

 Ideally Windows can automatically detect your device and set it as the default playback device every time it’s plugged into.

Here’s how to do it:

1. Exit Overwatch.
2. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type **mmsys.cpl** and press**Enter** .
