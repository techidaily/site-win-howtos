![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/no-detect.jpg)

 You must be vexing when you bought a Corsair Gaming keyboard but were welcomed with a “**NO DEVICE DETECTED. PLEASE CONNECT A DEVICE** “. You are unable to customize the profiles and LEDs on the keyboard due to the device tabs both being greyed out and unclickable which was a big selling point. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. And here’s methods that can help you fix this issue.

## Try these fixes

 There are common fixes and more complicated ones. You don’t need to try them all but it’s recommended to try the common fixes first. If these can’t help, try other fixes one by one to find the one that works for you.

### Common fixes

* Use another USB port.
* Reinstalling Corsair Utility Engine does not help, try to quit the software and rerun it.
* Disconnected the keyboard and held the**ESC** key while plugging back in.
* Press the**Windows key + F1** on the keyboard at the same time to do a hard reboot.
* Open**Task Manager** by pressing**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** together. Choose**CorsairHID.exe** and click**End task** , then restart Corsair Utility Engine.
* In the back of the keyboard, there’s the BIOS button. You can switch it to a different number for a try. You may see it suddenly detects the keyboard.
