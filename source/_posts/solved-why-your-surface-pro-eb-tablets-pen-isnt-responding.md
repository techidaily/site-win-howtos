**3)**  Leave your Surface Pro 4 for over**10** **seconds** .

**4) Start** your device. Then try your touch screen and see if it can work.  
  

## Method 2: Install system updates

## Method 3: Update the driver of your touch screen

 You may not be able to use your touch screen if you are using a wrong or outdated touch screen driver. You should verify that your touch screen has the right driver, and update it if it doesn’t.

 If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Diver Easy** can automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just**2** clicks (and you get**full support** and a**30-day money back** guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install**Driver Easy** .

**2)** **Run** **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button.

**3)**  Click the Update button next to a flagged touch screen driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click the Update All to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click the Update All).
