### What is WMI Provider Host (WmiPrvSE.exe)?

**[2: Boot into Safe Mode with Networking](#f2)**
**[3: Restart WMI Provider Host Service](#f3)**
**[4: Uninstall Components and Drivers Causing the Problem](#f4)**

## Fix 1: Run Virus Scan

 In some cases, the culprit is virus or malware. You just need to run your antivirus program to get it fixed. If you haven’t done it yet, you should do it right now.
