### Fix 1: Restore the X3DAudio1\_7.dll file

 If X3DAudio1\_7.dll is missing or not found in your computer, you can fix your problem by restoring the missing file in your computer. Here’s how:

3. Note that sometimes you may find that there are multiple files available. Mostly you can simple pick the highest version. But when the versions are the same, it could mean that the files work for different architecture. To find out the architechure of your system (whether it’s 64-bit or 32-bit), you can open[Windows Settings](ms-settings:about?activationSource=SMC-Article-15056) and check the**System type** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/windows-settings-architecture-1.jpg)

 Missing DLL files could imply a bigger issue, and sometimes on the system level. If the problem persists, you can use a system repair tool like[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to scan for system issues.

 Once install, check if your **x3daudio1\_7.dll**  missing problem has been fixed.

### Fix 2: Install DirectX End-User Runtimes

 The DirectX End-User Runtimes package provides updates to 9.0c and previous versions of DirectX – the core Windows technology that drives high-speed multimedia and games on the PC. So you can fix the x3daudio1\_7.dll missing or not found errors by installing this package in your Windows computer.

**Note** : It’s recommended to download and install the dll files from official website, and do not install the dll file from unknown source to avoid internal corruption and potential risks.

1. Go to[Windows End-User Runtimes download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) .
2. Select the**appropriate language** , and click**Download** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1500acb86cc.jpg)
3. Run the downloaded file, and follow the prompted instructions to finish installation.
4. Restart your computer and try the application that gave the error to see if it works now.

 This should resolve your issue. If not, don’t worry. We have other solutions for you.

### Fix 3: Reinstall the application

 As you can see in the error message, reinstalling the application can fix the x3daudio1\_7.dll missing or not found errors, because the installation files may contain the required DLL file. To do so:

2. Type**appwiz.cpl** in the Run box and click**OK** .

### Fix 4: Copy the file from another computer

 You can also fix this error by copying the same file from another computer and paste it to your own. To do so:

1. Find another computer that runs the same operating system as yours.  
 The versions (Windows 10/8/7) and architectures (32-bit/64-bit) of both operating systems must be the same.
2. On that computer, open File Explorer (by pressing the   **Windows logo key**  

 and **E** on your keyboard), then go to **C:WindowsSystem32** and copy the**X3DAudio1\_7.dl** l there.
3. Paste the copied file to the same location (**C:WindowsSystem32** ) on your own computer. (You may need an external storage device, like a flash drive.)

Try launching the application again and it should be working.

 That’s it. Hope this post serves its purpose and help you fix the x3daudio1\_7.dll missing or not found errors
