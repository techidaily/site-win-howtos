Right click on the**network icon** at the bottom right corner on your desktop, and click**Open Network and Sharing Center** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f04abb90727.png) If you don’t see “**Open Network and Sharing Center** ” there, you can click**Open Network and Internet settings** , then click**Network and Sharing Center** in**Settings** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ade913312.png) ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ae1eb2cb9.jpg)
2. Click**Change adapter settings** on the left.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ae4f8eabf.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9b0540f4ac.jpg)  
 You’ll need to repeat this step for any other connections that you’re not using.
