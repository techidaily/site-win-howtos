 But don’t worry. The following of this article will show you methods to fix your controller connection. They have helped many Xbox One gamers get rid of the issue and connect their controllers to their consoles. And they may also be able to help you.

2. **[Re-sync your controller](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Power cycle your console](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update your controller software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Method 1: Check the status of your controller

 You should check the basic status of your controller and see if there is any issue that causes the problem.

**1)** Check the**connection status** of your controller: Make sure your wireless controller is **close enough** to the console. Ensure that there is no**objects (such as a wireless router or a microwave oven)** or**USB or wireless devices (such as a headset or a flash drive)** that may interfere in the connection.

**2)** Check the**battery status** of your controller: Make sure the **batteries are not running out of power** . If your controller is running low on power, charge or replace the batteries and see if this resolves the problem.

## Method 2: Re-sync your controller

 If you are using a**wireless** controller, you can try re-syncing your Xbox One controller to the console to fix connection issues.

**1)**  Press the**connect** button on your console.

**\*** On Xbox One S, the connect button is a small circular button on the front of the console. On other versions of Xbox One, it is on the side around the corner from the disc tray.

**2)**  Press and hold the**connect** button on the back of the controller till the**Xbox button flashes** . After a few seconds you can see it switch back to a**solid light** , which means it is re-synced.
