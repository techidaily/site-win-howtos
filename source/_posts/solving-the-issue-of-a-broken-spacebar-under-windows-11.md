## 1\. Unmake recent changes

 If your touchpad cursor disappears all of a sudden, you’ll first need to recall if any recent changes to your computer caused the problem. For instance, recent Windows updates, touchpad-related driver updates, new software programs added, new hardware devices added, etc.

 If you don’t recall any recent changes made to your computer, the latest Windows update(s) and touchpad-related driver are always the first places you should be looking at. Here is how you can unmake the changes to see if it helps to bring back your touchpad cursor:

## 2\. Restart the touchpad with the function keys

 If the touchpad cursor disappears on your computer without you making any changes to your computer, you can try to re-enable the touchpad feature with the function keys.

 The exact key combination for the touchpad feature depends on different computer manufacturers. For instance, if you’re using an Acer laptop, the key combination to turn on and off your touchpad is uaually**FN + F2** or**FN + F7** . For ASUS, it could be the**F6** or**F9** key alone. You can usually tell the touchpad hotkey by the following icons:

 When the touchpad feature is turned off or on by the function key(s), there’s usually a notification that tells you such on your screen, like this:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-81.png)

 If you don’t see such a message on your computer, and your touchpad cursor remains missing, please move on.

---

## 3\. Uninstall conflicting software

 When your touchpad cursor disappears suddenly, you can’t miss the possibility of conflicts from third-party software programs: screen recording or remote access software may affect the touchpad cursor’s visibility. If you have any such programs installed, it’s best to uninstall them to make sure that they’re not the culprit to your disappearing touchpad cursor.

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and **R** key at the same time. Type **control panel** and hit **Enter.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-9.png)
2. View by **Categories,**  then select **Uninstall a program** under **Programs** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-8.png)
3. Click your remote control or screen recording software, then **Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-77.png)
4. Repeat the same until you uninstall all remote control and screen recording software programs.
5. Restart your computer afterward.

Then see if your touchpad cursor still disappears. If so, please move on.

---

## 4\. Update touchpad driver

 An outdated or incorrect touchpad driver could also be the reason why your touchpad cursor disappears, so if the above methods don’t help to restore your touchpad cursor back, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated touchpad driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

## 5\. Make sure you can see touchpad in Settings

 If you’ve done the above, but your touchpad cursor remains disappeared, it’s possible that the touchpad device itself is gone from your computer. In other words, it’s possible more a hardware issue than a software problem.

 So the next thing you should do is to make sure that you can still find your touchpad in Settings. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**I** key at the same time to open**Settings** .
2. Select**Bluetooth & devices** , and see if you can find a**Touchpad** card on the right side pane:  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006118/18460" target="_top" id="2006118"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006118" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006118/18460" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-82.png)

 If you don’t see a Touchpad tab here, it’s possible that your touchpad hardware is currently not recognized by your computer, which is also why none of the above troubleshooting helps to bring its cursor back.

 In that case, you’ll have to consider resetting or reinstalling your computer for the touchpad cursor disappearing problem to be fixed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Reset your computer

 As mentioned, if your touchpad is not seen in Settings, it’s possible that you’ll need to reset or reinstall your computer for the problem to be fixed.

 If you need help on how to do it, here’s a post on[ **Reinstall/Reset Windows \[Step By Step\]** ](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) : the screenshots are from Windows 10, but the instructions work on Windows 11 as well.

 If your touchpad cursor is still gone even after the computer reset or reinstallation, the problem is definitely on the hardware front. In that case, you should talk to your computer vendor to see if they can help to repair your touchpad. If your computer is out of warranty, you’ll need to seek help from a hardware technician to get your touchpad working again.
