### Fix 1: Update your device drivers

 One of the most common causes of this error is corrupted or outdated device drivers. So you should definitely try updating your drivers before trying anything more complicated.

If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
