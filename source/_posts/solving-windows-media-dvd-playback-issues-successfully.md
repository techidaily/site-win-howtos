 If you are seeing an**access denied** file or folder error on your Windows system, you are not alone. Many Windows users have got it. This usually occurs when they are accessing or making changes to a file or folder. Sometimes the error appears when upgrading from a previous version of Windows.

**Why does the error appear?**

 In many cases, you can get this error because you don’t have the appropriate ownership or permissions to access or change the file or folder. But the error may also occur if the file or folder is corrupted.

 This is an annoying issue. It stops you from opening or changing the file or folder. And there may be some important data in that folder but you can’t access them now. But not to worry. Here are a few tips that can help you fix this error or save your data:

 Method 1:[**Take the ownership of the file or folder**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Method 1: Take the ownership of the file or folder

 The access denied error may occur if you don’t have the ownership of the file or folder or the ownership has changed. You can try taking the ownership and see if this resolves the problem.

 Note that the steps to take the ownership on Windows 10/8 is slightly different from the steps on Windows 7\. The following part will show you how to take ownership on the these different systems.

**IMPORTANT:**  You should log on your operating system as an administrator before you go on — An administrator has the privileges to make advanced changes to the file or folder and the steps as follows require those privileges.

 If you are not clear if your account type is administrator, click the**Start** button in the lower left corner of the screen and then type “_**account**_ “.

## Method 3: Recover your data

 It is also possible that you get the access denied error because the file or folder you are accessing is corrupted. You can’t open it or make any changes.

But still you can utilize some data recovery tools or services to recover data from a corrupted folder. So if the data in the problem folder is important for you, you can try using find some programs or services to perform data recovery in order to save them.
