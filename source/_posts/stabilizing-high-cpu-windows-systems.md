## What is USB tethering?

 You can share your phone’s mobile data with another device, like your laptop, through **tethering** . It makes your laptop be able to connect to the Internet when there’s no network connection. There are three types of tethering:**USB tethering** ,**Wi-Fi tethering** ,**Bluetooth tethering** .

 USB tethering has the fastest speed among the three ones. It requires a USB cable to connect your laptop with your phone. But at the same time, it makes your phone suck power from your laptop’s USB port instead of draining.

## Is it free to use USB tethering?

 Whether it will cost your money or not, it depends on your carrier. In the US, most carriers do charge. You can**consult your carrier’s website** for further information.

 If you use a third-party tethering app, it’s possible to be free to use USB tethering. But even that, sometimes your carrier can still detect your tethering. Then you might have to pay.

## How do I fix USB tethering not working on Windows 10?

 When the USB tethering stops working on your Windows 10, probably the USB tethering driver on your computer is corrupted, old or missing. Replacing the driver with the built-in one on your Windows 10 manually, or updating your USB tethering driver via Driver Easy automatically, these two methods can always help you solve the problem.

 If you are not confident playing around with the drivers manually, or you don’t have the time or patience, we highly recommend you to use Driver Easy to help you solve the driver problem automatically.
