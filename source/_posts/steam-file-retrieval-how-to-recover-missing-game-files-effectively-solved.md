![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/update-your-device-drivers.png)

4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
5. Launch Oddworld: Soulstorm and check to see if crashing issue has been resolved. If yes, then great! If the issue persists, please try **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: Run Epic Games Launcher as administrator

 Oddworld: Soulstorm requires administrator privileges in order to access protected system resources. If the game or the game client doesn’t have the required permissions, you may encounter crash. So you should make sure to run Epic Games Launcher as administrator to see if it fixes the issue.

Here’s how:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4: Verify game integrity on Epic Games Launcher

 To verify the integrity of Oddworld: Soulstorm, you should first navigate to**Library** in**Epic Game Launcher** . Then locate Oddworld: Soulstorm and click on the**cog icon** in the lower-right corner and click**Verify** .

 Wait a bit until the process finishes. After that, re-launch Oddworld: Soulstorm to see if it can be played properly. If yes, then congrats! If it’s still no joy, please try**Fix 5** , below.

### Fix 5: Allow Epic Games Launcher through firewall

 A firewall is a network security system that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic by permitting/blocking specific traffic based on a set of security rules. You should allow the launcher through the firewall to make sure that the connection isn’t lost.

 To make sure you allow the app to communicate through Windows Defender Firewall:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then type **control firewall.cpl**  into the box and press **Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/run-1.png)
2. In the window that pops up, click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Allow-an-app-or-feature-through-Windows-Defender-Firewall.png)

<a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467" border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Change-settings-Allow-another-app.png)
4. Once completed, click **OK** .
5. Run the game in the launcher and see if it still crashes. If it’s still on-going, please move on to**Fix 6** .

 If you have anti-virus software running in your computer, make sure you disable it temporarily too. During this time, be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download.

### Fix 6: Install the latest patch

 The crashing issue may be an unintended bug ensconced in the patches of the game. If this is the case, the developers would respond to this and address the issue with a new patch. So you can check out the latest patch to see if it helps fix the issue.

 If there’s no new patch available, or the problem remains after installing the latest patch, head on to**Fix 7** , below.

### Fix 7: Perform a clean boot

 Oddworld: Soulstorm may crash because of software conflict. In this case, you should perform a clean boot. A clean boot restarts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, allowing you to narrow down the programs and servicies so that you could potentially pinpoint the offender.

Here are the steps to perform a clean boot:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to bring up the Run box. Type or past **msconfig**  and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/msconfig.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/service-and-hide-all-microsoft-services.png)
3. Browse through the full list of services, make sure to **check the boxes for the items that belong to your hardware manufacturers** (such as Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm) and**uncheck the boxes for the rest** . Once finished, click**OK** to apply the changes.

   * **If Oddworld: Soulstorm stops crashing** , you can try repeating these steps, disabling half of the services each time until you isolate the culpable program.

   * **If Oddworld: Soulstorm still crashes** , please continue to**Fix 8** .

### Fix 8: Reinstall Oddworld: Soulstorm and the launcher
