 There are two ways you can get the right drivers: manually or automatically.

**Download and install the driver manually** – You can update your driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically update drivers** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install it correctly:

3. Click the**Update button** next to the selected driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

### Method 6: Roll back your audio driver

 So, roll back your driver to the previous version to solve the issue.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and **R** together to invoke the Run box.
2. Type “devmgmt.msc” and click**OK** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/05-1.jpg)
