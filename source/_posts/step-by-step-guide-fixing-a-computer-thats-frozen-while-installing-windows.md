## How do I fix Shift key not working?

A quick check before we start:

**Do the other keys on your keyboard work fine?** — Try to press any other key on your keyboard to see if it works.

 If the other keys work fine, then try to turn off the Sticky Keys feature on your Windows via the**Solution 1** .

If the other keys stop working either, check the next question:

 **Does your keyboard work via another USB port or computer?**  — Try to connect your keyboard with another USB port, or plug it into another computer to see if your keyboard works.

 If your keyboard works with another USB port, then the problem is on the USB port. You can use your keyboard with the working USB port then.

 If your keyboard works with another computer, then the problem is probably due to your Keyboard driver, save your Shift key through updating the keyboard driver via the**Solution 2** .

### Solution 1: Turn off the Sticky Keys feature on your Windows

 The Sticky Keys feature, besides, Toggle Keys and Filter Keys, make your keyboard easier to type. However, sometimes they make trouble. Your Shift key stops working is the one. So make sure these features are not turned on.

Follow these:

#### on Windows 10

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/win-key.png)**  and**I** (at the same time) to invoke the Settings window.

 2) Click **Ease of Access** .

 3) Select **Keyboard** on the left pane. Then make sure the status of **Sticky Keys, Toggle Keys**  and **Filter Keys** are all set to **Off** . If there is any one set to **On** , switch it to **Off**  instead.

4) Press the Shift key on your keyboard to see if it works.

 If your Shift key keeps not functioning, try to update your keyboard driver as Solution 2 tells.

### Solution 2: Update your keyboard driver

 This problem may be caused by an old, corrupted, or missing keyboard driver. If so, you can solve it by updating the keyboard driver.

 There are two ways to update your keyboard driver — manually and automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your keyboard driver manually by going to the keyboard manufacturer’s website for your devices, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows versions.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your keyboard driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find all the available correct drivers, and it will download and install them correctly :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. Your keyboard driver is no exception.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to your keyboard driver to automatically download and install the correct version of it (you can do this with the **FREE** version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **Pro** version which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
