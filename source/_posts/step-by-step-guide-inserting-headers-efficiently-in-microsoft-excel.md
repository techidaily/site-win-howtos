##  Two Ways to Make a Header in Excel

 One way to add a header in Excel is to use an option in the "Insert" tab. If you are looking to add a header to a specific worksheet, use this method.

 The other way to use a header in Excel is to utilize the "Page Setup" dialog box. Use this method if you want to add a header to multiple worksheets at once.

 Footers are added the same way as headers, so use the same steps below if you want to add a footer to your spreadsheets.

##  How to Insert a Header in a Single Worksheet

 To add a header to your single worksheet in Excel, first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 In your spreadsheet, at the bottom, click the worksheet in which you want to add a header.

![Choose a worksheet.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-excel-select-worksheet.png) 

 In [Excel's ribbon at the top](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-honor-play-40c-to-mac-drfone-by-drfone-android/), click the "Insert" tab.

 Your worksheet's view will immediately change, and you can now start adding your header.

 At the top of your worksheet, you have a left, middle, and right section to specify your header's content. Click each section and add your header content.

 To stop editing the header, click anywhere outside of the header section.

 To add a line break, press Enter after a line. To insert an ampersand "&" sign, type the "&" key twice.

 If you want to add dynamic content to your header, such as the current page number or [the current date](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-photos-from-android-gallery-app-on-redmi-note-12-5g-by-stellar-photo-recovery-android-mobile-photo-recover/), then in Excel's ribbon at the top, click an appropriate option.

![Select a dynamic item to add to the header.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-dynamic-header-items.png) 

 Similarly, if you'd like a different header for the first page, or different headers for the odd and the even pages, use the "Different First Page" and "Different Odd & Even Pages" options at the top.

![Use different headers.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-different-header.png)

 To go back to Excel's default viewing mode, in the ribbon at the top, click View > Normal.

![Select View > Normal from Excel's ribbon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7-excel-normal-view.png)
