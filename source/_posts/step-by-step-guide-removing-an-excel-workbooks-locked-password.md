## Change or Remove an Excel Workbook Password on Windows

 To change or remove the password of an Excel workbook, you're going to need to know the current password in order to open the document to begin with. Go ahead and [open the workbook](https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-quik-exploring-the-best-pc-video-editing-software-for-gopro-users/) and enter the password.

 Once you've opened the workbook, click the "File" tab.

 Next, click "Info" in the left-hand pane.

![Click Info.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Click-Info.-1.png) 

 On the Info screen, click "Protect Workbook" to show a drop-down menu.

 If you removed the password, then all you need to do now is save your workbook. If you changed the password, you'll be asked to confirm the new password. In that case, retype the password in the text box and then click "OK" to confirm.

![Click File.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Click-File.-1.png) 

 Next, click "Passwords" near the bottom of the drop-down menu.

![Click Passwords.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Click-Passwords..png) 

 The File Passwords dialog box will appear. To remove the passwords, delete the passwords from each text box, leave each box blank, and then click "OK." To change the passwords, enter the new password in each text box and then click "OK."

![Enter new passwords.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Enter-new-passwords..png)

![Confirm the password.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Confirm-the-password..png)
