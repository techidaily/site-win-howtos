### Key Takeaways

 To import a JSON file into Excel, open Excel to the Data tab and navigate to Get Data > From File > From JSON. Pick how you want your data to be imported, and Excel will handle the rest automatically.

 Have you [received a JSON file](https://driver-error.techidaily.com/error-eradicated-graphic-driver-installed-flawlessly/) that you'd like to convert to Microsoft Excel format? Excel offers a built-in option to help you import it without third-party parsing tools. Here's how you can do it.

 To convert your JSON file to Excel, you will first connect Excel to your JSON data. You'll then review the JSON data, select the columns you'd like to bring to your Excel file, and finally load the data into an Excel spreadsheet.

 You will then save that spreadsheet as [an XLSX file](https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-quik-exploring-the-best-pc-video-editing-software-for-gopro-users/), and your JSON to Excel conversion is done.
