4. Once done, run Apex Legends and see if the Easy Anti-Cheat error has been resolved. If it’s no joy, please continue with**Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: Run Apex Legends and Origin as Administrator

### Fix 4: Verify connectivity to Easy Anti-Cheat

 You may encounter this error is Easy Anti-Cheat isn’t properly connected. To verify your connectivity to Easy Anti-Cheat, navigate to these two sites:

* [https://download.eac-cdn.com/](https://download.eac-cdn.com/)

**If you see the 200 – HTTP OK message** , it means your connection to Easy Anti-Cheat is healthy. You can rule this out as a possible cause and move on to Fix 6 to continue troubleshooting.
