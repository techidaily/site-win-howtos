### **Fix 1: Disable Exclusive Mode and change the sound format**

 Having**Exclusive Mode** on means the specific app will take full control while in use so that other apps cannot play audio through the device. But the feature can sometimes interfere with the audio driver, hence the**crackles in speakers** problem. To disable**Exclusive Mode** :

1. On your keyboard, press   **the Windows logo key**  and type**audio** , then click**Manage audio devices** .
