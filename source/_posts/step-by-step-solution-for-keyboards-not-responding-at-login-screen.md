 If Windows doesn’t load the keyboard driver for your laptop automatically, you can update the keyboard driver in these alternative ways: manually or automatically.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the Scan Now button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
