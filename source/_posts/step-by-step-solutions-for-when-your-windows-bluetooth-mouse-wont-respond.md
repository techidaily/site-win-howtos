## AOC Screen Issues on Windows 10? Here's Your Step-by-Step Solution

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/img_5bbdbe55a63de.jpg)

 When you plug your AOC USB monitor, if your computer goes totally black screen, you definitely encounter the AOC USB monitor not working issue. This issue may happen after you upgrad your computer to Windows 10\. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. And this should be easy to fix.  
 Read on to find how…

1. **[Run troubleshooter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Reinstall the AOC USB Monitor driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Method 1: Run troubleshooter

 Windows has built-in troubleshoot to fix the common error in the operating system. This issue may due to hardware conflicts. To solve the problem, you can run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. Here’s how:

1. Type “troubleshoot” in the search bar and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/8.23.1.jpg)
2. Find**Hardware and Devices** then click.
3. Click**Run the troubleshooter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/troubleshoot.jpg)
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.
5. Relaunch your computer and check the issue is resolved or not.

 If you fail to find Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter in Control Panel, that’s probably because your computer version is after **Windows 10 build 1809** . The version has removed the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter. Don’t worry, you can still run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter in this way:

1. Right-click on the**Start** button, then click**Windows PowerShell (Admin)** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2020-05-07_15-52-49.jpg)
2. Copy and paste**msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic** in the PowerShell, then press the**Enter** key.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2020-05-07_16-02-37.jpg)
3. You’ll see the**Hardware and Devices** window popping out. Click**Next** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2020-05-07_16-05-33.jpg)
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.
5. Relaunch your computer and check the issue is resolved or not.

## Method 2: Reinstall the AOC USB Monitor driver

 If fix 1 can’t help, then try to uninstall and reinstall the AOC USB monitor driver to fix the issue.

1. Press**Windows logo key + R** to open the Run box.
2. Type “devmgmt.msc” and press**Enter** .

### Step 2: Download AOC USB monitor driver

 There are two ways you can update your AOC USB monitor drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-aoc-usb-monitor-not-working-on-windows-10/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 AOC keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **AOC** website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

1. Go to the **[AOC service center](http://us.aoc.com/en/service)**  .
2. Search for the monitor on the webpage.
