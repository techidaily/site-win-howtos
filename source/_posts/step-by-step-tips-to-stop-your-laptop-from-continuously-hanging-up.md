### Fix 1: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 When you find your battery is not charging, you need to troubleshoot hardware issues first. Follow the steps below to troubleshoot hardware issues:

1) Check if your power cable is damaged.’

2) Drain your battery. Then try charging it.

* **If your battery is charging** , this issue may be caused by**the battery charge threshold** . You can try**[Fix 2](#f2)** to resolve this issue.
* **If your battery is not charging** , maybe this issue is caused by**a bad battery** or perhaps**your** **AC adapter malfunctions** .

 3) If possible,**use a new AC adapter to charge your battery** . See if this issue persists. If this issue persists, maybe this issue is caused by a bad battery. If the battery is charging, it suggests that there is something wrong in your AC adapter.

 4) If possible,**use your current AC adapter to charge a new battery** . If the battery is charging, it indicates your battery is bad. If the new battery is not charging, perhaps it is the AC adapter that triggers this issue.

### Fix 2: Turn off the battery charge threshold

 Some laptops have**the battery charge threshold feature** . This feature allows laptop users to customize the battery charge threshold so that when the battery reaches that threshold, the battery won’t charge.

 This is a useful feature if you primary use your laptop with the AC adapter attached and only infrequently use the battery power.

 Check if your laptop supports this feature. If you don’t know, you can**consult the manufacturer of your laptop** for further support.

 As far as I know, Lenovo ThinkPad supports this feature. If you’re using a ThinkPad which currently runs Windows 10, you can follow the instructions below to check if you accidentally turn this feature on:

 1) Open the**Lenovo Vantage** app.

 2)**Turn off** the toggle under **Battery Charge Threshold** if it is turned on.

 After you turn off the battery charge threshold feature, your battery should be charging.

### Fix 3: Perform a power reset on your laptop

**Try performing a power reset on your laptop** to see if the battery not charging issue persists. Here is how to do it:

1. Shut down your laptop and**disconnect the AC adapter** .
2. Remove your laptop battery,**press and hold the power button for 30 seconds** and then release the power button.
3. Put your battery back in and plug your charger into your laptop.
4. Turn on your laptop.

 See if the battery is charging. If so, you’ve fixed this issue. If the issue reappears, don’t worry. Try the next fix.

### Fix 5: Update the driver for your battery management device

 This issue is also probably caused by a missing or outdated**driver for your battery management device** . Try updating the driver for your battery management device to see if this issue can be fixed.

 There are two ways to update your sound card driver:**manually** and **automatically** .

**Update the driver for your battery management device manually** – You can go to the manufacturer’s website to download and install the latest version of the driver for your battery management device. Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact sound card model and your version of Windows.

**Or**

**Update your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your sound card driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all** .

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click**Update** next to your battery management device to automatically download the correct version of its driver, then you can install it manually. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All.**  You get **full support** and a **30-day money back** guarantee).
