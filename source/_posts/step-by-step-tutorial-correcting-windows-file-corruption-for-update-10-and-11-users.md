 You can install all your system updates one by one using the steps above. Though it can cost a lot of time, it is an effective way to update your Windows 7 when Windows Update is malfunctioning.  
  
## 5) Perform a Clean Boot

 If you have tried some methods and the issue persists, you need to check if there is any application that is interfering with Windows Update.

**a)** Press**Windows logo key** and**R key** on your keyboard at the same time to open**Run** dialog. In this dialog, type “_**msconfig**_ ” and hit**Enter** . This will open System Configuration window.
