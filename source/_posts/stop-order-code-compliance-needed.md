 If you have tried the above fixes but none seems to work, it’s perhaps worth considering whether or not your PC is equipped to play the game.

 Below I have listed both the minimum (for playable performance) and recommended (for optimal performance) requirements for Windows PC. You can check how your system measures up against these specifications.

| |  MINIMUM**SPECIFICATIONS** | RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS                                                                    |                                                                       |
