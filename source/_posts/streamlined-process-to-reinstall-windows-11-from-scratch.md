## What is System interrupts?

 System interrupts are an official part of the Windows operating system. It manages the communication between your computer hardware and system. You can find it shown as a process in Task Manager. That’s used to display the CPU usage of all hardware interrupts.

 If you find System interrupts keep taking up over 20% of CPU usage, it means there’s some error with your hardware or the driver. Go with the following solutions to fix it.

## Solution 1: Quick & Easy

 First of all, try to restart your Windows 10 computer. No kidding! A complete reboot can always fix a lot of weird issues. Thus be sure to try it at first as it’s easy enough to take.

## Solution 2: Update your device drivers

 If your device driver misbehaves, then the error may also occur. So you can update your drivers to try to fix the issue.

1. Press the**Windows** logo key +**X** key to open the quick access menu. Then click**Device Manager** to open it.

2. Expand any dialog and**right-click** on your device to choose**Update driver** . Choose**Update driver** and click**Search automatically for updated driver software** .  

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_595c88ea4cdfe.jpg)
3. Then Windows will start to detect the update for your device.

 After updating one device, check for updates on your other devices with the same steps.

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_595b0c9c888b5.png)

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_595ca8968c9bd.png)
4. See if the system interrupts still consume a high CPU usage on your computer.

## Solution 5: Repair system files

 If you are facing persistent issues and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it’s possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that   **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones. By scanning your PC comprehensively, Fortect can provide a more comprehensive and effective solution for repairing your Windows system.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you**a detailed report of your PC status** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-scan.jpg)
3. Once finished, you’ll see a report showing all the issues. To fix all the issues automatically, click**Start Repair** (You’ll need to purchase the full version. It comes with a**60-day Money-Back Guarantee** so you can refund anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-repair.jpg)

 The repair is available with the paid version of Fortect that comes with a full money-back guarantee and full technical support. If you need any assistance, feel free to contact their support team.

## Solution 6: Consider a system reset

 If none of the above helps to fix the high CPU usage problem trigger by System interrupts, you may need to consider a Windows reset: it wipes out all software incompatibilities and problems, it’s also the rule of thumb in telling a software problem from a hardware one: if the problem remains even after a system reset, then it’s definitely a hardware problem.
