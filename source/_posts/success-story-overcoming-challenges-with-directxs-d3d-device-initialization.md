 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE**   or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you’ll have a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
