6) Run the Network Diagnostics and see if it goes well.

### Solution 2: Give the network service and local service administrator privilege on your Windows

 This problem could happen due to the service doesn’t have access to run properly. You can easily fix it by giving the services administrator privilege.

 1) Type**cmd** in the search box from the Start menu. Then right-click on**Command Prompt** or**cmd.exe** to select**Run as administrator** .

 2) Type the following commands and press**Enter** after each.

net localgroup Administrators /add networkservice  
  
net localgroup Administrators /add localservice  

 If you’re on**Windows 8** , you’ll need to add a space before “service”. So, the commands for you to type would be:  
 net localgroup Administrators /add network service  
 net localgroup Administrators /add local service

 You should see a message saying**The command completed successfully** after each.

 5) Run the Network Diagnostics to see if it goes well. If it keeps giving you the error, install the latest driver for your network adapter then.

 You can update your network adapter driver manually by going to your motherboard or computer manufacturer’s website, searching for the most recent correct driver for your network adapter. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows system.

**Note:** If you can get access to the Internet on your computer, then download the driver file from another working computer and save it to the USB flash drive. Then you can install the driver on your target computer through the USB drive.

 Alternatively, If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network adapter driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact network adapter, and your variant of Windows system, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59ad30f1e3ff8.jpg)

3) Click the **Update**  button next to a flagged network adapter driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **Pro** version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

 Driver Easy requires network connection to update drivers. If your windows can’t access the Internet, please use the Offline Scan feature of Driver Easy to help you.

 4) After updating your network adapter driver, please restart your computer.

 5) Run the Network Diagnostics to see if it goes well.
