## Solution 1: Turn off the Sticky Keys and the Filter Keys feature

 Sticky Keys and Filter keys are two accessibility functions in the Windows operating system. Sticky Keys allows you to press one key at a time for keyboard shortcuts; Filter Keys tells the keyboard to ignore your brief or repeated keystrokes. If these two keyboard functions are enabled, sometimes your backspace key cannot work fine.

 Follow these steps to turn off these two features to get your backspace to work again:

#### Window 10
