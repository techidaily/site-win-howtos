**1)**  Press and hold the**power button** of your Surface Pro 4 for about**30** seconds and then**release** it.

**2)** Press and hold the**power button** and the**volume up (+) button** together for about**15** seconds. (Please do**NOT** let go when you see a logo pop up on the screen.)

**3)** **Wait** for over**10** seconds.

**4) Start** your device and check if your Surface Pen works.  
  
 If the methods above cannot help you, you may need to consider your problem as a hardware issue. In this case, you may need to contact Microsoft support. They can offer you any further assistance you need.
