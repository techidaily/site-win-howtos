## **Bonus tip: Update your driver to the latest version**

 To reduce such annoying problems, in most cases, it is a good idea to update your drivers to the latest version. There are two ways to update your drivers: **manually**  and **automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually**  – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your device. Be sure to **choose the driver that is compatible with your Windows system** .

**or**

**Update your drivers automatically**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

You can update your drivers automatically with either **the FREE**  or **the Pro version**   of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Click **Update**  next to your device to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can install it manually. Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All**  ).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap20-3.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
