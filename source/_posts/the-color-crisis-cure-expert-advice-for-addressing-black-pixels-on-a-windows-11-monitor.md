## Bouncing Back on Windows 11 File Explorer Scroll Bar Issue: Methods to Fix It Now

If you are having problem making your scroll bar scroll to position other than the top, this post is what you are looking for.  
  
Let me be more clear to see if the description fits your situation: you open a folder in your**File Explorer**, let say, to see the pictures. After you finish viewing the first screen of the pictures, you want to scroll down a little bit to see more, but you find the scroll bar on the side won’t budge, it just keeps jumping to the top position no matter how many times you roll your mouse wheel.

2) On the left side of the pane, choose**Colors**, and the on the right side of the pane, make sure the option**Automatically pick and accent color from my background**option is slide to **Off**.
