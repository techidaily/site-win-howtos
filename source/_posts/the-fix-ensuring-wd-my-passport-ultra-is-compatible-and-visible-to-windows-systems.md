### Bonus tip

A missing or outdated graphics driver may also stop items from appearing properly on PC. You should make sure your graphics card driver is up to date. There are two ways to update your graphics driver: **manually** and **automatically**.

**Update your graphics driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your graphics card. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your graphics driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee.)
