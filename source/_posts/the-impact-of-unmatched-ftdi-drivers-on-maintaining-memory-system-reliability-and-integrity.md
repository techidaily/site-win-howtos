## Critical Update for FTDI Systems: Avoid Compatibility Errors and Preserve Memory Integrity

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-48.png)

 Memory Integrity can’t be turned on due to incompatible driver ftdibus.sys

 No need to worry much about it if your Memory Integrity is turned off due to incompatible drivers like ftdibus.sys: for one, Windows Defender is already strong enough to fend off malware for you, so Memory Integrity is more like the icing on the cake. For two, it’s not that hard a problem to fix. We have here 3 ways that you can get the incompatible fdtibus.sys driver problem fixed. Read on and see more.

## How to fix the incompatible fdtibus.sys driver that turns off Memory Integrity

 Generally speaking, you can reinstall or update the incompatible driver mentioned in Core Isolation to fix the fdtibus.sys driver issue. The tricky part is how you can do it, without harming the functionality of the mentioned driver. Follow the instructions below to see how this can be done easily.

1. **[Reinstall ftdibus.sys driver](#m1)**
2. **[Update ftdibus.sys driver](#m2)**  
   1. **[Manually](#m2.1)**  
   2. **[Automatically](#m2.2)**

## 1\. Reinstall ftdibus.sys driver

 ftdibus.sys is a system file for FTDI (Future Technology Devices International) USB devices, which are usually preinstalled on your computer chipset. So you may not recall using FTDI USB devices yourself, which makes it quite hard to update or reinstall the driver. But things don’t have to be like this: follow the instructions below to see how you can reinstall the ftdibus.sys driver:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key at the same time. Type**cmd** and hit**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to open Command Prompt as administrator. When prompted for permission, click**Yes** .

2. Type this command:**`pnputil.exe -d oem<NUMBER>.inf`** and hit**Enter** .  

 The <NUMBER> here should be filled with the number you see on your computer. For instance, I’m seeing**51** , so my command should be**`pnputil.exe -d oem51.inf`** .

3. This is how the command looks like on my computer. Hit**Enter** when the command is typed in.

4. When you see**Driver package deleted successfully** , restart your computer for the ftdibus.sys driver to be install automatically by Windows again.

 Go go the Core Isolation window again to see if the fdtibus.sys driver is still regarded as an incompatible driver that stops Memory Integrity from turning on. If so, please move on.
