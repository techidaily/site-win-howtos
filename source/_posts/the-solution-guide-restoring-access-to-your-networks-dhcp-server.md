##  Method 1: Closing background applications

 You may get the rendering device lost error because there are applications (e.g. TeamViewer) running in the background that are conflicting with Overwatch. You can check the applications running on your computer and disable them one by one to identify the one that causes the problem.

**Be careful!** Don’t turn off any program or process that are essential for your Windows.

##  Method 2: Reset the frequency settings of your hardware components

 Your game may crash because you have overclocked your CPU, GPU, or any other components. You should set their frequency/clock speed settings back to the default and see if this can fix your error.

 If resetting doesn’t work, you can try slightly underclocking your CPU. Lower the clock speed of your CPU a bit, and then check to see if your game runs fine.
