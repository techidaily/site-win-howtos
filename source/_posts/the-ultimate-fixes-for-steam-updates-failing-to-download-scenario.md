4. Start a game in PUBG and see if the lag issues have been fixes. If the issue persists, please move on to**Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: Lower your game resolution

Running PUBG in a lower resolution can also help in fixing lag:

1. Create a shortcut of your PUBG, then right-click on the**shortcut** and click**Properties** .
2. Under the **Shortcut** tab, in **Target** field, leave**a space** and type**resolution:** **the resolution of your preference** (1024Ã—768 for example).

### Fix 5: Change the power option and adjust for best performance

 By default, the power plan on our computer is often configured to **Balanced**   or **Power saver**   to conserve battery, which largely compromises the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU.

 Also the system performance on our computer may also be undermined for the advanced graphics features.

So to tweak the settings:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **R**   at the same time, then copy & paste **powercfg.cpl**   into the box and press **Enter** .

2. Choose the **High performance** option.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4c4f0b203f9.jpg)
3. In the top-right corner of the window, type **advanced**  and click **View advanced system settings** .
