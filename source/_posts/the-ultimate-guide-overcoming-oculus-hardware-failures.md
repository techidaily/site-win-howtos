### Fix 1: Remove any USB peripherals and wait for the update process to finish

 If you seldom check for Windows updates, it may take a long time for Windows to complete the update process. Maybe your PC is not “stuck” at Windows update, and Windows is just configuring and installing update packages.

 If you temporarily don’t need to use your PC, you can just wait for 2 to 3 hours to see if the update process can be completed. If there are any USB devices (like printers, USB flash drives, etc.) connected to your PC, you can try removing them from your PC. Some Windows users reported that after they disconnect all the USB peripherals from their PCs, the update process completes quickly.

 See if this issue persists after you wait for 2 to 3 hours. If it persists, try the next fix below to force restart your PC.

### Fix 2: Force restart your PC

 If Your PC gets stuck at 100% when you’re performing a Windows update, you need to force restart your PC first. If you don’t know how to do it, you can follow the instructions below:

1. Press and **keep holding** the power button on your computer case **until your PC shuts down** .
2. **Disconnect** any external power supply or remove the battery from your laptop.
3. **Hold down** the power button for about **15** seconds.
4. **Wait a few minutes** and then plug in your PC or connect the battery to your laptop.
5. Press the power button again to reboot your system.
6. **Select the option to boot normally** if you get a notice that the computer shuts down improperly.

 If you still cannot access the desktop, you can try starting your PC in safe mode with the network. When you sign into your Windows system in safe mode with the network, try the next fix below to run the Windows Update troubleshooter.

### Fix 3: Run Windows Update troubleshooter

 Perform a Windows update again to see if you can install the update. If this issue reappears, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 4: Reset Windows Update components

 If Windows Update components are corrupted, Windows Update may not work properly. Maybe that’s the reason behind this issue. To resolve it, try resetting Windows Update components. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog. Type **cmd** and press **Ctrl** , **Shift** and **Enter** at the same time to **run Command Prompt as administrator** . You’ll be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to open the Command Prompt.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Snap468-1.png)
2. In Command Prompt, type the command lines below and press Enter on your keyboard after typing each:  

 net stop bits  
 net stop wuauserv  
 net stop appidsvc  
 net stop cryptsvc  

 Note: The Windows Update-related system services will be stopped after executing the command lines above.
3. In Command Prompt, type the following command lines and press Enter after typing each:  

 ren %systemroot%\\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old  
 ren %systemroot%\\system32\\catroot2 catroot2.old  

 Note: You will rename the SoftwareDistribution and catroot2 folder as SoftwareDistribution.old and catroot2.old after you run these two command lines. These two folders are used by Windows Update to save temporary update files.  

 By renaming these two folders, Windows will think these two folders are missing, and Windows will create new ones to store Windows update files. By doing that, you can avoid many Windows Update issues caused by the old corrupted temporary files in these two folders.
4. In Command Prompt, type the following command lines and press Enter after each:  

 net start bits  
 net start wuauserv  
 net start appidsvc  
 net start cryptsvc  

 Note: After you execute the command lines above, you start the Windows Update-related system services.

 Check to see if this resolves your Windows Update problem. Hopefully, it did. But if not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 5: Download updates from Microsoft Update Catalog manually

**[Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/home.aspx)**  offers updates for Windows 2000 SP3 and later versions of the Windows operating system. You can try downloading the updates you failed to install from the Microsoft Update Catalog and install them manually to see if you can fix this issue.
