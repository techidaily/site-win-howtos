## Fix 1: Check if your PC supports Miracast

 Miracast is a wireless technology that makes it possible for users to mirror one’s device’s display to another device. Before using it, the first thing you need to do is check if your device supports it.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **dxdiag** , then press **Enter**  on your keyboard.

## Fix 2: Check if WiFi is enabled on both devices

 Miracast is a WiFi standard. So to connect your computer to another device, you must use WiFi. Many users report that the reason they can’t use Miracast is that they were using Ethernet. After they switched to WiFi, they can connect their computer to other devices. Here’s how you can check if WiFi is enabled on your computer:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **ms-settings:network-wifi** , then press **Enter**  on your keyboard.

![check if WiFi is enabled on computer ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/check-if-WiFi-is-eneabled-on-computer-step-1.jpg)

 3) Click on the toggle to activate WiFi if it’s deactivated.  
  
![check if WiFi is enabled on computer](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/check-if-WiFi-is-eneabled-on-computer-step-2.jpg)

 4)Also, you need to check if WiFi is enabled on other devices. For iOS and Android users, you can usually activate WiFi from the**Settings** app.

 Once enabling WiFi on both your PC and display device, connect them to the same network.

Now you can check if it works:

 1) In the Search box, type**projection** . Select**Projection settings** from the result.  
  
![open projection settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/projection-settings-1.jpg)

 2) The error message should be gone.

## Fix 3: Reinstall your wireless network adapter driver

 If you have WiFi enabled but can’t really connect to WiFi and still see the error message, you should reinstall the wireless network adapter driver. There is a possibility that your wireless network adapter driver is out of date or corrupted, which would prevent you from connecting your PC to the Internet. If the wireless driver is the culprit, reinstalling it will get you back online in minutes. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![windows logo key](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Windows.png) and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type **devmgmt.msc** , then press **Enter**  on your keyboard.

 3) Expand**Network adapters** . Select your wireless network adapter driver, right-click on it and select**Uninstall device** .

![uninstalll wireless network adapter driver via Device Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reinstall-wireless-network-adapter-driver.jpg)

 4) Restart your computer and Windows will reinstall the driver automatically. (Note: you need to connect to the network.)

 If reinstalling the wireless network adapter driver didn’t resolve your issue, you should[verify your network driver to check if it’s compatible](#fix4) .
