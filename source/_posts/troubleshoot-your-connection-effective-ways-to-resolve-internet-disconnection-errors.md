### Fix 1: Do some basic troubleshooting

 You may encounter this problem because of physical issues. It can be that your USB device happens to be faulty or the USB port you’re plugging your devices into are failing.

To rule out this as a possibility:

1. Connect your USB devices to a different computer. If it’s working properly on the other computer, then your computer (instead of the USB device) is most likely at fault. If it still keeps disconnecting, then move on to step**2.** , below.
2. Connect your USB devices to a different (and functioning) port to see if it fixes the issue. If yes, then great! If the**USB still keeps disconnecting** , move on to**Fix 2** .
