### Fix 3: Use the Ethernet connection

It’s recommended to use the Ethernet connection, since playing games like Destiny 2 requires a more stable and faster Internet connection.

1. Right click on the**network icon** at the bottom right corner on your desktop, and click**Open Network and Sharing Center** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59f04abb90727.png) If you don’t see “**Open Network and Sharing Center** ” there, you can click**Open Network and Internet settings** , then click**Network and Sharing Center** in**Settings** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ade913312.png) ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ae1eb2cb9.jpg)
2. Click**Change adapter settings** on the left.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ae4f8eabf.jpg)
3. Right click on the**connections** that you’re not using, and select**Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9b0540f4ac.jpg)  
 You’ll need to repeat this step for any other connections that you’re not using.

Still no luck? Ok, there’s one more thing to try.
