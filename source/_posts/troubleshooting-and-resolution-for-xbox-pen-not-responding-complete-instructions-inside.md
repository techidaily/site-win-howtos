 Sometimes the function keys on your keyboard could be locked by the F lock key. As a result, you can’t use function keys. Check if there was any key like**F Lock** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1-2.png) or **F Mode** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2-2.png) key on your keyboard.

### Fix 3: Update your keyboard driver

 If the keyboard driver on your computer is old or incompatible, functions keys may not function either. You can solve it easily through updating your keyboard driver.

 Whether you choose to update the device drivers manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

To update your drivers with Driver Easy, just click the **Scan Now**  button, then when it lists the drivers you need to update, click **Update**  . The correct drivers will be downloaded, and you can install them – either manually through Windows or all automatically with **[Driver Easy Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .
