### Fix 1: Connect to the Destiny 2 server in another time

It’s possible that too many people connect to the Destiny servers during the time period, so the servers are overloading and you will fail to connect. So you can wait for a while and try playing the game in another time. This issue can be automatically fixed. If you still have the error “**Destiny 2 servers are not available**”, don’t worry. There’s something else to try.

### Fix 2: Disable DHCP for your connection
