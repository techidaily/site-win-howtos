### Fix 2: Update your touchpad driver

**Update your drivers manually** â€“ You can update your**touchpad driver** manually by going to the**Lenovo** â€™s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver for the exact device. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows system versions.

**OR**

**Update your drivers automatically** â€“  If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your **touchpad** **driver** manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either[**the FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:
