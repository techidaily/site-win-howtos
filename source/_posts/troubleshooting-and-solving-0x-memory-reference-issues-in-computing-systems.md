### **Fix 4: Close FAR(Fix Automata Resolution) Mod**

 Fix Automata Resolution (FAR) is developed by Nier Automata. By manipulating the graphics requirements of the game, users with lower specs can play the game. But FAR can be the reason for the Nier Automata crashing problem.

 If you have already enabled FAR mod, you can disable it and restore the game settings to default to solve the problem. Then restart your computer to check whether it solves the problem or not.

### Fix 5: Change processor affinity

 According to practice and some users experiences, processor affinity can help users get rid of the crash. You can try this method, but if it works for you, you have to repeat it every time when you launch the game.

1. Run the game, then press the**Windows logo key** +**R** together to open the run box.
2. Type “taskmgr” and press**Enter** to open the Task Manager.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/task.jpg)
3. Choose**Details** . Find Nier Automata.exe, right-click on it and click**Set affinity** .

4. Select only**Core 0** and**Core 2** then click**OK** .
