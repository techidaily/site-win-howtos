## Try these fixes

 You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Update your drivers](#a)**
2. **[Check for Windows Updates](#b)**
3. **[Scan for malware on your computer](#c)**
4. **[Perform a clean boot](#d)**
5. **[Run the Command Prompt](#e)**

### Fix 1: Update your drivers

 Updating drivers should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong with your computer or system. Whether you choose to update the device drivers manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.

There are two ways you can update your drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](#a1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#a2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturers of your hardware keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to each manufacturer’s website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your drivers

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

### Fix 2: Check for Windows Updates

 Windows Updates can also address bugs related to both hardware and software. So make sure you’ve installed all the new Windows Updates to keep your computer running smoothly. Here is how to do it:

 The screens shown below are from Windows 10, but the method also applies to Windows 7 and 11 too.

### Fix 3: Scan for malware on your computer

 Malicious software on your computer, including viruses, spyware, and ransomware, can also cause application errors. So, you should run your malware remover to detect if there is any malware running on your computer.
