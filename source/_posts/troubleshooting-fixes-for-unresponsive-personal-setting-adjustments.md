**2)** Right click**Steam** (or**Steam.exe** ) and then click**Properties** .

##  Method 2: Temporarily disable your antivirus

 Your Steam error is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If this resolves your problem, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.
