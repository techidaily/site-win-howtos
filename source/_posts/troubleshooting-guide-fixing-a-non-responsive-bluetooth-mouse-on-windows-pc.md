### Method 1: Remove browser extensions

 Extensions are small software programs that customize the browsing experience. They can let users set up Chrome functions according to the individual’s needs and preferences.

1) Double click the Google Chrome shortcut.

2) Type “chrome://extensions” in the Chrome address bar and press**Enter** .

 If the error is solved, you’ll know there is something wrong with at least one extension.  

 4) Enable your installed extensions one by one to find which one is causing the problem. Then disable or remove it.

### Method 5: Add`“--process-per-site”` parameter

 Chrome creates a completely separate operating system process for each tag or extra extension you use. If you have multiple tabs open and various third-party extensions installed, you may find many processes running at the same time.  
 Multiple Chrome processes running in the background could be the reason for the unresponsive error. Therefore, preventing Chrome from opening too many processes could solve this problem.

 1) Right-click on your Google Chrome shortcut and click**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 2) Under the**Shortcut** tab, add`“--process-per-site”` in the Target box and then click**Apply** .  
 Next, a window will appear. Click**Continue** , then click**OK** .  
**Note** : There’s a space before`“--process-per-site”` .

 3) Restart Chrome and open a URL in the third-party app to check whether the error will appear or not.

**Note** : If this method works for you, you should start Chrome with this shortcut every time.

### Method 6: Rename the Google Chrome profile

 Corruption of Chrome’s system default files could also cause this error. You can create a new Chrome profile to solve it by simply renaming the Default folder.  

1) Make sure your Google Chrome is closed completely.
