### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

A corrupt or outdated graphics driver is one of the common reason of the Hearthstone lagging issue. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes the issue.

Driver Easy handles it all. You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** of Driver Easy.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c25c6b728e28.jpg)

### Fix 4: AdjustBlizzard settings

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c25c750aa1fa.jpg)
3. Run Hearthstone again and see if the lagging has been reduced.

### Fix 5: Delete the log.config file

Deleting the**log.config**file is another proven method to reduce lag according to user feedback. Here’re the steps to delete the file:

1. In Blizzard, click**Hearthstone** \>**Options** \>**Show in Explorer** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c25e255100a8.jpg)
2. As soon as the Hearthstone folder pops up, completely exit Blizzard (and Hearthstone).
3. Double-click on **the Hearthstone folder** and then delete the **log.config** file.
4. Restart your computer, launch Hearthstone and see if the Hearthstone lagging problem has been fixed. If yes, then congrats! But if the problem still exists, you should try**Fix 6** , below.
