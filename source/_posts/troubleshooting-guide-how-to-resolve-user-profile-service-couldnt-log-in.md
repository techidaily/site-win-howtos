Restart your Chrome and go to the website to see if successfully.

## Method 5: Check the website in your Firewall

 If the website you want to access was blocked by your Firewall, this error would also occur. Check your Firewall settings and remove the website if you find it.

Restart your Chrome and go to the website to see if successfully.

## Method 6: Make sure you’re going to the secure website

 To enable users to browse safely on Chrome, Chrome requires websites use trustworthy certificates. A secure website must have trustworthy SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) certificates; In other words, if the website doesn’t have a trustworthy SSL certification on Chrome, you may face this error.

To check if a website is secure:

### Way 1: See its URL

 Over a secure connection, the address should begin with **https** (note the **s**  at the end).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Way 2: See the security status on the address bar of Chrome
