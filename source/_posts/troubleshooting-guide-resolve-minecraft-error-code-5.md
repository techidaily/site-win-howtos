## Method 5: Check the website in your Firewall

Restart your Chrome and go to the website to see if successfully.

## Method 6: Make sure you’re going to the secure website

To check if a website is secure:

### Way 1: See its URL

 Over a secure connection, the address should begin with **https** (note the **s**  at the end).

### Way 2: See the security status on the address bar of Chrome

To the left of the website address, check the security status:
