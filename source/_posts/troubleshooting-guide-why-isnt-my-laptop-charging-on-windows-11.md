### Method 4: Update your graphics driver

 It’s also possible that your**Windows 10 blurry text** problem is being caused by driver issues — **the graphics driver on your PC is outdated or faulty** . The steps above may resolve the blurry text problem, but if they don’t, or you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your (graphics) drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it**takes just 2 clicks** (and you get full support and**a 30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. **Run** Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
