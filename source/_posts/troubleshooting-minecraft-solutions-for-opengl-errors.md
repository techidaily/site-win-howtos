[Bonus tip: Update your drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Change your download region

 Steam provides servers in regions. When you meet the “Steam content servers unreachable” message, it’s possible that servers in this region are out of service. So you can solve the problem by simply changing your download region to use other servers to update your games.

1. Run Steam.
2. Click the **Steam** button in the upper left corner. Then click **Settings** . ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/un1.jpg)

3. In the Download tab, in the Download Region section change the region in the drop-down menu.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/un2.jpg)
4. Restart Steam and you’re all set.

### Method 2: Change your proxy settings

 Proxy servers can be used to open the restrictions of Internet access. The proxy can track the network and provide an alternate gate for users. But this feature often becomes the boundary for Steam to connect with its servers. So, disable your proxy settings may help you solve the problem.

1. Press the**Windows logo key + R** to open the Run box.
2. Type “inetcpl.cpl” and press**Enter** .

5. Relaunch Steam and check your download speed.

### Method 3: Turn off your router’s safe-web

 The “Steam Content Servers Unreachable” can be caused by your Wi-Fi router. It’s because your Wifi router may have a setting called safe-web. This setting is designed to protect your computer by filtering websites and data that it believes are not trustworthy. But it is possible that it list Steam as untrustable. Therefore, turning off this setting may help you solve the problem.

 Due to the various brands in the market, you can go to your Wifi router’s official website to find a way to turn off this setting. You can also contact the manufacturer for help.

 Note: Before using this command, if you’re dealing with a certain game, try relaunching steam and verifying cache files first.

3. Run Steam. You should be able to download games smoothly.

### Method 6: Disable/Uninstall antivirus software

 The “Steam Content Servers Unreachable” problem may also be caused by the conflict between your antivirus software and Steam. Therefore, disabling or uninstalling the antivirus software and then restarting your computer can help you solve the error.

 If this method resolves the problem, you can install another antivirus software to protect your computer. But if you are fond of the old one, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful in using the Internet after uninstalling/disabling your antivirus software.

## Bonus tip: Update your drivers

 It is very important to update your graphics card drivers. Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter issues like crashing, freezing, or not launching. So it’s really important to keep your drivers updating to improve your gaming experience.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-steam-content-servers-unreachable/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer’s official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
