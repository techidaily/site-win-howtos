   * **I’m using a wired keyboard** : double check that your keyboard has been connected properly. If typing still can’t catch up, try **2)** .  
   * **I’m using a wireless keyboard** : replace/charge the battery if needed. If the typing still can’t catch up, try**2)** .
2. Try a different (and functioning) keyboard on your computer. Test if the delay still happens. If the issue disappears, then it’s probably that the first keyboard is faulty. If the delay issue still occurs, then move on to**Fix 2** , below.
