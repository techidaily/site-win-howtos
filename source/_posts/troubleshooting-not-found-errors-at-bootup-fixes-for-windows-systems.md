## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Run your Steam client in compatibility mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Temporarily disable your antivirus**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your device drivers**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

##  Method 1: Run your Steam client in compatibility mode

 Your Steam client may not be working well because of compatibility issues. And you should change the compatibility mode setting for your Steam client.

**1)** Open**File Explorer** (press the**Windows logo key** and**E** on your keyboard at the same time), then go to where you’ve installed your Steam (the default location is _C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\_ ).

**2)** Right click**Steam** (or**Steam.exe** ) and then click**Properties** .

**4)**  Double click**Steam** (or**Steam.exe** ) to run the Steam client. If this method works for you, you won’t see this error again.

##  Method 2: Temporarily disable your antivirus

 Your Steam error is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If this resolves your problem, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

##  Method 3: Update your device drivers

**Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading , and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .

**2)** Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
