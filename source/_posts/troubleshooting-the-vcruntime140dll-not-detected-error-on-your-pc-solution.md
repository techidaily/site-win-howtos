### Fix 2: Make sure the volume is audible

 Sometimes the mic on A40 won’t work simply because the volume is mute or set too low.

To make sure the volume is audible:

1. Click **the sound icon**  on the lower-right of your screen, then move **the volume slider**  all the way  to at least halfway up.

 If there’s a volume control on the app you’re playing, make sure to slide the volume bar to an audible level too.
2. Test if your A40 headset is working properly. If not, then move on to **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

 Ideally when a new audio device is inserted, Windows will automatically set it as the default audio playback device. But that’s not always the case and sometimes we’ll have to set default devices manually and set its sound levels.

To do so:

1. Right-click on  **the sound icon**  on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click  **Sounds**  .
