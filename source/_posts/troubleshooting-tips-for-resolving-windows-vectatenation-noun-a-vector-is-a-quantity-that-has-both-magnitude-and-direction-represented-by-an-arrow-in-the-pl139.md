In these circumstances, you can temporarily disable antivirus program in your computer, then play your game to see how it works.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics card driver

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to manually update your driver, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.
