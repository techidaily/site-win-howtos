### Fix 3: Check the connection

 You can only play COD: WW 2 with stable and constant internet. So check your connection from the console and try reconnecting to Xbox live. This bug could be related to the internet connection.

Use a wired connection if you’re a PC player.

* You need to make sure you’ve signed into your system account. If there’s a problem when signing into your account, it’s probably you have connection issues.

**Troubleshooting on** [**Xbox One**](https://beta.support.xbox.com/help/Hardware-Network/connect-network/network-settings#83dc7f0c62b1417fb8f85ef45393a1f1) **/** [**PS4**](https://support.playstation.com/s/article/Troubleshoot-Wired-or-Wireless-Network-Connection?language=en%5FUS) **/** [**Steam**](https://support.steampowered.com/kb%5Farticle.php?ref=1456-EUDN-2493) **.**

* If you were signed in but couldn’t connect, you need to check the connectivity alerts on your system’s status page.  
 PS4/Xbox one players are suggested to test your connection to find the culprit.

**Test connection** **For PS4 player**

1. From the PlayStation home screen, select **Settings** .
2. Select **Network** .
3. Select **Test Internet Connection** and allow the test to run.

**Test connection** **For Xbox one player**

1. Turn on your Xbox One without a disc inside and go to **Xbox Home** .
2. Go to **Settings** and select **Network** .
3. In the right-hand column, select **Test network connection** , and allow the test to run.

### Fix 4: Reinstall the game

 Uninstall the game and reinstall it could simply rewrite data files. The error code may be fixed by this fix.

1. Press**the Windows logo key and R** on your keyboard at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type **appwiz.cpl** , then press **Enter** on your keyboard.

## Update your driver

 It is very important to update your drivers, especially for gamers. To geta a better gaming experience, your device driver should be upgraded to the latest version. This can prevent your computer from potential problems.

 You may say Windows updates could help you do the job, but Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version and sometimes it won’t tell you your device drivers need to be updated.

 So **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  comes to help.

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.
