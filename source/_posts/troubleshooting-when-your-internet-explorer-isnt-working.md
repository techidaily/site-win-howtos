## Troubleshooting Destiny 2: Get Your Game Up and Running Again

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc9ab9e09904.jpg)

Having an error on Destiny 2 saying:**Destiny 2 servers are not available**? Don’t worry. This is a common Destiny server issue and you can fix servers not available in Destiny 2\. Why is Destiny 2 server unavailable? It’s very likely that too many people connect to the servers at the same time period, and the servers are overloading. So you can’t currently connect to the server and get the servers unavailable error. In addition, the network problems in your computer can also result in the error. But the good news is, this is not a difficult issue to resolve.
