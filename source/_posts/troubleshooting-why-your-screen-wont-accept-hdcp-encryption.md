### Fix 2: Update your audio driver

 One of the most common causes of this problem is an outdated or a faulty audio driver. So you should always make sure to keep the latest audio driver up-to-date. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy.

### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

 Ideally Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set it as the default playback device every time it’s plugged into. But that’s not always the case and sometimes we’ll have to set default devices manually and set its sound levels.

To do so:

1. Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3c30ff817bf.jpg)
2. Click the **Recording** tab, then click on **your microphone device** and click **Set Default** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3c319e23198.jpg)  
 If **your microphone device doesn’t show up in the device list** , then right-click on **the empty space**  and tick **Show Disabled Devices** . Then right-click on the microphone device once it appears and click **Enable** before you do step **2)** .
3. Click on **your microphone device again** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3c32c5b638d.jpg)
4. Click the   **Levels**  tab, then drag   **the Microphone slider**  all the way to  _its top_  and click  **OK**  .

5. Click **OK**  to apply the changes in the windows.

6. Now that with**microphone set as default device** and**the volume turned up** , test your mic and see if the **microphone not working on laptop**  problem has been fixed. If it’s still not working right, move to**Fix 4** , below.

### Fix 4: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 If none of the fixes works for you, it’s time to check for potential hardware issues.

You can follow the steps below to narrow down and troubleshoot:

1. Connect your microphone device to **another port**  on your laptop. If the mic works in the other port, it suggests this issue is probably caused by a faulty port, if your mic still doesn’t work, move on to**2)** , below.
2. Connect your microphone device to **another computer** . If your mic works in another PC, you should contact the vendor of your laptop for advice; if your mic still doesn’t work in another PC,  you should contact the vendor of your microphone device for support.
