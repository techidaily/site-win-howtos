## 1) Change installation location

You may encounter an error 1603 because the installation location is you choose is not available due to various reasons — such as being encrypted. You can use another installation folder to install the program and see if the error is gone.

## 2) Completely uninstall the same program installed

If you have previously installed the same program (or its earlier version), the error can occur when you try to install the application again. If you want to install your program successfully, you need to perform a **clean uninstall** of the one installed on your computer. This means you need to remove all the temporary files and preferences it leaves in addition to the major program. Sometimes you may lose the desktop shortcut of a program due to some reasons and therefore you may forget that you have installed it. In this case you can go to**Control Panel**to check if it is still on your computer: Press**Win + R**, and enter “ _**control**_“;
