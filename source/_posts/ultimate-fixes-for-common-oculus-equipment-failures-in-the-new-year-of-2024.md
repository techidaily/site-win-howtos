![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/img_5a375f9959471.png)

 Wireless network has become more critical in our daily lives, but can you imagine this: one day you connect to your WiFi as usual, but your**WiFi is not working** anymore, and you loss the access to the Internet. Isn’t it a horrible thing?

 The WiFi not working issue includes: WiFi connection failed or[WiFi not showing up](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Sometimes it’s difficult to locate the cause. However, you can easily fix WiFi not working without paying much time and patience! Try the fixes in this article and solve your problem step by step!

[**Check your WiFi**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**If WiFi not working in your Windows PC/laptop**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[**If WiFi not working on your iPhone**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

**Why is my WiFi not working?** There are several reasons that cause the WiFi stops working. It can be the problem with your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your WiFi settings or your device. You can try to check your WiFi itself and the device that has the problem to solve it.

 First of all, you may need to check if the same WiFi problem occurs in another device. For example, if your WiFi is not working in your Windows, you can try the WiFi on your mobile phone to see if it works, and vice versa.

 If your WiFi doesn’t work on both devices, it should be an issue of your WiFi. So you can[check your WiFi itself](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 If your WiFi works on your iPhone, but doesn’t work on your Windows, maybe it’s a problem of your Windows. So you can[check your Windows PC/laptop](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 If your WiFi works on your Windows, but doesn’t work on your iPhone, maybe it’s a problem on your iPhone. So you can[check your iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## **Check your WiFi**

 If your WiFi is not working on many devices, the cause of the problem may lie in the WiFi itself. There should be something wrong with your WiFi. Follow the steps below to troubleshoot until your problem is solved.

### **Step 1: Restart your modem and wireless router to fix WiFi not working**

 This problem can be probably caused by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) issue. Restarting your modem and wireless router can help you reconnect to your WiFi service.

**Note** : Anyone who is connecting to the network will be disconnected temporarily while you are doing this.

 1) Unplug your wireless router and modem from th power source (remove the battery if your modem has a battery backup).

 2) Wait for at least 30 seconds.

 3) Plug your wireless router and modem back into the power source again (put the battery back to the modem).

 4) On your device, reconnect to your WiFi network.

### **Step 2: Check if the WiFi signal is blocked to fix WiFi not working**

 As we all know: the weaker your WiFi signal is, the worse your WiFi is working. So please pay attention if there is anything that may prevent your WiFi signal from being connected. You can check the possible conditions below:

 1) Put your router as**in the center** as possible, and make sure to be as**closer** as possible to the router, in order to get better WiFi signal.

 2) Make sure that there are**no obstacles covering upon your router** , because that may affect the router’s performance, too.

 3)**Thick walls** can also reduce the WiFi signal and prevent you from connecting to the WiFi.

 4) Check any device that may interfere with your WiFi signal, such as: your**cordless phone, microwave oven and Bluetooth speaker** . If these devices use the same 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequencies as your WiFi does, your WiFi signal can be interfered by using the same frequency. Try to temporarily turn off those devices and connect to your WiFi again.

 If your WiFi restarts to work after getting better signal, the problem is caused by the WiFi signal. Then you can try to move your device closer to your router, or consider buying a[WiFi range extender](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Wi-Fi-Extender-Essentials-EX2700/dp/B00L0YLRUW/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?ie=UTF8&qid=1513591490&sr=8-3&keywords=wifi+signal+extender&tag=easeware-lillianlai-20) to solve your problem.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **Step 3: Change your WiFi frequency and channel to fix WiFi not working**

 If your WiFi stops working in the crowded apartments when too many people connect on the same WiFi channel at the same time, you can try to change your WiFi frequency and channel to solve this proboem.

 Usually WiFi network frequency has 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Now many routers are the dual-band model and both support 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. **If your router is dual-band, it will automatically choose to broadcast at 5 GHz when it’s crowded connecting at 2.4 GHz** .

#### How to check if my WiFi uses 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz?

 Generally speaking, 802.11a/ac uses the 5 GHz band, 802.11b/g uses the 2.4 GHz band, and 802.11n uses either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz band. if they don’t match or include the frequencies of your router, the WiFi network won’t show up on your computer.

**For your WiFi frequency** : You can know your WiFi frequency by checking the**interface of your router** , or checking the**router’s manual** .

**For your phone’s WiFi frequency** : Now many smart phones support 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, so you don’t need to worry about that.

**For your Windows WiFi frequency** :

 1) Type**cmd** in the search box, right click**Command Prompt** (right click**cmd** if you are using Windows 7) to click**Run as administrator** , and click**Yes** to confirm.

 2) Copy the command below and paste it in Command Prompt, then press**Enter** .

netsh wlan show drivers

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 **If your devices can only work with 2.4 GHz frequency, you are very likely to have the network congestion issue, so you can change the WiFi channel to solve your problem** . And there are only 11 channels available to choose. Among these, only channel 1, 6, 11 are most commonly used.

 Follow the instructions to set it up (Here we take a TP-link WiFi router as an example):

 1) Check the**IP address** ,**Username** and**Password** on your router.
