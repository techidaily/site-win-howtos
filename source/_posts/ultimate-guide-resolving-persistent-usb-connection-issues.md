<a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054" border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3: Run Apex Legends and Origin as Administrator

 Apex Legends requires administrator privileges in order to access protected system resources. If the game or the game client doesn’t have the required permissions, you may receive Easy Anti-Cheat error. So you should make sure to run Apex Legends and Origin as administrator to see if it fixes the issue.

 After that, launch Apex Legends game and see if the Easy Anti-Cheat error still occurs. If it doesn’t, then great! If the issue persists, please try**Fix 4** , below.

### Fix 4: Verify connectivity to Easy Anti-Cheat

 You may encounter this error is Easy Anti-Cheat isn’t properly connected. To verify your connectivity to Easy Anti-Cheat, navigate to these two sites:

* [https://download.eac-cdn.com/](https://download.eac-cdn.com/)
* [https://download-alt.easyanticheat.net/](https://download-alt.easyanticheat.net/)

**If you see the 200 – HTTP OK message** , it means your connection to Easy Anti-Cheat is healthy. You can rule this out as a possible cause and move on to Fix 6 to continue troubleshooting.

**If you’re not presented with the message** , then something is blocking your Internet connection. You can move on to**Fix 5** to check if your firewall is the culprit, if not, you should contact your Internet Service Provider to locate the problem.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5: Add Easy Anti-Cheat and Apex Legends to your firewall exceptions list

 A firewall is a network security system that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic by permitting/blocking specific traffic based on a set of security rules. You should allow Easy Anti-Cheat and Apex Legends through the firewall to make sure that the connection isn’t lost.

 To make sure you allow these programs to communicate through Windows Defender Firewall:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Then type**control firewall.cpl** into the box and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/run.png)
2. In the window that pops up, click**Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .
