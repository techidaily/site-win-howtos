## 1\. Update graphics card driver

 The LiveKernelEvent 144 error is, in many cases, related to a faulty or missing graphics card driver. So making sure that you have the latest and the correct graphics card driver installed is one of the first things you should do.

 To make sure that there’s no old bad graphics card driver files left in your system, here’s what you need to do first:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key at the same time, then type**devmgmt.msc** and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-22.png)
2. Double-click to expand the**Display adapters** category, then right-click your display card and select**Uninstall device** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Tick the box for**Attempt to remove the driver for this device** and click**Uninstall** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-24.png)
4. Repeat the same to remove the driver for your other display card if you have one.
5. Then update your graphics card driver.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

## 2\. Check USB peripherals

 If the LiveKernelEvent 144 error is seen with a blue screen of death error, then it should relate to your USB devices. To see if this is your case, you can do the following:

1. Remove all external USB devices from your computer, except for your keyboard and your mouse.
2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key at the same time, then type**devmgmt.msc** and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-22.png)
3. On the menu bar, select**View** , then **Show hidden devices.**  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-13.png)
4. Double-click the expand the category**Universal Serial Bus controllers** . There should be some grey-out devices there.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-14.png)
5. Right-click one of the grey-out devices you see here and select**Uninstall.**  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

6. Click**Uninstall** to confirm.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-16.png)
7. Repeat the same to remove all the other grey-out devices you see here.
8. Restart your computer afterward.
9. Then plug the USB devices back into your computer one by one, preferably into the USB outputs on your computer rather than USB hubs or docks.
10. Pay extra attention to any computer glitches you notice with your computer after plugging each USB device back in.

 If the LiveKernelEvent 144 error happens again after a certain USB device, then it should be the culprit. You should then see if this USB device causes the same problem on other computers. If so, then this device needs to be replaced or repaired.

 If the above USB test doesn’t show any problem, but the LiveKernelEvent 144 error still persists, please move on to the other methods below.

## 3\. Make sure the PSU works well for your machine

 The LiveKernelEvent with code 144 error can sometimes relate to your insufficient power supply for all your hardware components, especially when the LiveKernelEvent 144 is seen after your computer shuts down unexpectedly or freezes whenever you’re running resource-hungry programs.

 Here’s[**a post from Dell**](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fsupport%2Fkbdoc%2Fen-us%2F000125185%2Fhow-to-troubleshoot-the-power-supply-unit-psu-of-a-dell-desktop-computer) with more information about the power supply if you’re interested in knowing more and seeing how you can test your PSU.

## 4\. Update your computer BIOS and system firmware

 Please note that wrongly updating BIOS could cause server computer problems, even brick the computer in some extreme cases. So please do not attempt the BIOS update if you’re not confident in doing it.

 The LiveKernelEvent with code 144 error could also be caused by outdated BIOS and system firmware, so you should update them as well. Even though a BIOS and firmware update won’t usually boost your computer performance, it can, however, fix problems or bugs related to certain hardware, and thus stop problems like LiveKernelEvent 144.

 You can refer to this post we have on **[how to update the BIOS and firmware](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Then see if the LiveKernelEvent 144 error happens again. If so, please move further.

## 6\. Consider a system reinstall

 If the LiveKernelEvent with code 144 error still remains after all the above, the next thing you should consider is a Windows reinstall, given the time and energy spent already.

 Windows 10 and 11 have actually made it much easier to accept the system reinstallation process: you can choose to keep all your files and install them back after the system reinstall, without having to lose them over to the reinstallation.

 To reinstall or reset your computer, here’s a post for your reference:[ **Reinstall/Reset Windows 10 \[Step By Step\]** ](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

Then see if the LiveKernelEvent 144 error is still seen.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 7\. Seek help from a hardware technician

 If the LiveKernelEvent with code 144 error remains even after a system reinstallation, it’s without a doubt that the problem is on the hardware front. This is what a system reset or reinstallation does: it wipes out all software incompatibilities and problems.

 In this case, if your computer is still under warranty, just let your computer vendor know about this, and they should take care of it from there. If not, you may need to seek help from a hardware technician to see if a certain hardware component you own is at fault. This is because the hardware testing process usually requires some tools and professional knowledge to tell which part goes wrong. If you’re not tech-savvy enough on this front, it’s better done by the pros.
