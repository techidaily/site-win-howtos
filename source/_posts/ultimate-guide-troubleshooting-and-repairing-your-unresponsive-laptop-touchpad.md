### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

1. Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .

2. Connect your microphone device to **another computer** . If your mic works in another PC, you should contact the vendor of your laptop for advice; if your mic still doesn’t work in another PC,  you should contact the vendor of your microphone device for support.
