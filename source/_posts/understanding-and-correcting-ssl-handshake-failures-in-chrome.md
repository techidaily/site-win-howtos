 If your webpage went all red with white text saying**Google Chrome Critical ERROR** when you browsing on Google Chrome, don’t trust it! It’s a scam! And Google Chrome is not the only affected browser. Users have reported they’ve seen similar tech support scam popups on Yahoo and MSN homepage.

 If you close the webpage straight away without clicking any links, unfortunately, you’ve done the**WRONG** thing! But don’t worry, read this post and you’ll know how to get rid of it.

## End the process

 Yes, clicking the “**X** ” button to close the page is the first reaction for most people. But the page like this scam uses our reaction to get permission to infect our devices. So they could let the page pop up again.
