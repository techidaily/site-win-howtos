 **Option 2: Troubleshoot for Possible Causes and Their Fixes**
  
* **Due to Malware of Antivirus Software**
  
Malicious software may be the causes of random hangs or freezes, among other problems. Run a full scan of your computer using the protection software that you trust to see if you can detect any suspicious programs that you should completely uninstall.
  
Also, out-dated antivirus program could render the computer into having random freezes. Update your anti-virus program and its virus database to see if it helps.
  
In other cases, users with more than one anti-virus programs installed and running at the same time might have this problem. To fix it, uninstall all the other anti-virus programs but one.
  
* **Application Compatibility or other software problem**
  
If the random freezing or locking up only happens recently, try recollect if you have recently installed some programs or device drivers on your PC. Locate them and then uninstall them completely to see if the problem goes away.
  
If you are having problems figuring out which program or driver is the culprit, we recommend you to perform a**system restore**.
