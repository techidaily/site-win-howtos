### Fix 2: Install the correct latest Wacom pen driver

 Your Wacom pen cannot work issue is probably due to an old, corrupted or missing**Wacom pen driver** . You can easily fix it by updating the Wacom pen driver on your Windows.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE**   or the **Pro**   version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   and install Driver Easy.
