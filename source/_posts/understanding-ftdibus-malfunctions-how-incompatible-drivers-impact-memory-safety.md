### Fix 2: Update your Wacom driver

 When something goes wrong with your Wacom tablet, updating its driver should always be your go-to option. It’s essential that you have the latest correct driver for your device at all times.

There are two ways you can update your Wacom driver:

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
