### Method 3: Update your device drivers

 If, after trying the above, the issue still exists or your PC is still running slow, it’s time to update your device drivers.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for all your devices:  
 manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your devices, and searching for the most recent correct driver for each. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your devices, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next toany flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the **FREE** version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

5) On your keyboard, press the **Ctrl**  +**Shift**  \+ **Esc**  keys (at the same time) to open your Task Manager, check to see if Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry takes up a normal disk usage.

 **Note:** If you can’t find gpedit.msc on your Windows 10 computer, here’s how you can get it: 1\. Download gpedit.msc(Group Policy Editor) from Internet  
 2\. When it’s done, Go to C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64, and copy the followings:  
 folders: GroupPolicy  
 GroupPolicyUsers

 3\. Paste them in the following locations:
