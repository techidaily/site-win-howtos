### Fix 2: Try the function keys

 Sometimes the mouse-isn’t-moving issue happens just because you’ve pressed the function keys and disabled trackpad unknowingly. If that’s the case, we might have to press the keys again to turn it back on. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, hold down**the Fn key** and press**the touchpad key** (or**F7** ,**F8** ,**F9** ,**F5** , depending on the laptop brand you’re using).
2. Move your mouse and check if the **mouse frozen on laptop** issue has been fixed. If yes, then great! But if the problem persists, move on to**Fix 3** , below.
