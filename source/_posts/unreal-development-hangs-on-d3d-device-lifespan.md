## 2\. Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card is an important hardware that decides whether your computer can run games smoothly. And the graphics driver acts as an interpreter between Windows and your device. If the driver is outdated or corrupted, you may run into any sorts of problems which can ultimately prevent your game from launching. Therefore, to ensure that you can enjoy your game, you should update your graphics driver:

 There are two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://uperfect.sjv.io/g1jgba) and **[automatically](https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/jrkzxp)** .

## 3\. Install the newest version of DirectX

 If your Windows is up to date, the latest DirectX will automatically be integrated into your system. For Windows 10 users, you should have DirectX12 and should also be able to run DirectX11 and DirectX10\. But for some reasons, you may not have the latest DirectX installed on your Windows. In this case, you need to install the newest version of DirectX by visiting the[DirectX download page](download-directx) .

## 4\. Uninstall Vanguard

 Riot Vanguard is designed to set both game safety and personal computer safety as a priority. However, it has the capability of blocking drivers and certain components in your computer will not be working when you’re playing Valorant. And that could be the reason why you would get the error message. To troubleshoot the issue, you can try uninstalling Vanguard:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows + I** keys simultaneously to open Settings.

 2) Click**Apps** .
