### Method 1: Install the correct latest printer driver

 This problem could be caused the driver you try to install. Please**make sure the driver file is the correct latest one** .

 There are**two ways** you can get the right driver for your printer: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your printer driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your printer, say, HP, canon… and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your printer manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact printer, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Method 2: Install the printer as administrator

 Sometimes you get this error if you log in your computer using non-admin user account. In this case, you can **reboot your computer and then log in with an administrator account** . Once you do, try to install the printer driver again, it should go well this time.

 Hopefully this helps. Feel free to comment below if you have any questions.
