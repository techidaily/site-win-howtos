### Solution 1: Update your USB controller driver

 If your**USB controller driver** is corrupted, old or missing, the error probably occurs.

 You can update your USB controller driver either manually or automatically.

**Option 1 –** You can go the**manufacturer’s website** for your brand computer or USB controller, then search for the latest USB controller corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

**Option 2 –** If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the USB controller driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just**2 clicks** :

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b9a2dfa5436f.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
 Note: You can do it**for free** if you like, but it’s partly manual.

### Solution 3: Adjust your BIOS setting

 There’s one setting called**Legacy USB Support** , which enable you connect older USB device with the USB 3.0 port. If it’s not turned on, you might also get the error.

Follow to enable Legacy USB Support:

1. **Restart** your computer. Immediately press the function key, like**F2** , to enter the**BIOS** of your system.  
 The specific key to Enter BIOS commonly is F1, F2, Esc, F10, etc. You might see a message, like Press F2 to STEUP, telling you the correct key when your system reboots.
2. Once your system boots into BIOS, press the**right arrow key** on your keyboard, to select**Peripherals** . Proceed to press the**down arrow key** to select**USB Configuration** , then**press Enter** .
