### Fix 4: AdjustBlizzard settings

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c25c750aa1fa.jpg)
3. Run Hearthstone again and see if the lagging has been reduced.

---

### Fix 5: Delete the log.config file

Deleting the**log.config**file is another proven method to reduce lag according to user feedback. Here’re the steps to delete the file:

1. In Blizzard, click**Hearthstone** \>**Options** \>**Show in Explorer** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c25e255100a8.jpg)
2. As soon as the Hearthstone folder pops up, completely exit Blizzard (and Hearthstone).
3. Double-click on **the Hearthstone folder** and then delete the **log.config** file.
4. Restart your computer, launch Hearthstone and see if the Hearthstone lagging problem has been fixed. If yes, then congrats! But if the problem still exists, you should try**Fix 6** , below.
