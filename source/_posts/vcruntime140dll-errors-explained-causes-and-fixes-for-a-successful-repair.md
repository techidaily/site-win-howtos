### Fix 2: Install the latest patch

 Game developers always keep releasing patches to improve their games and fix any issues, so you should check for updates of your game in Steam or from the official website. Then install the latest patch to keep it up to date. This can fix your DirectX error.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics card driver

 There are two ways to update drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually update the driver** – You should go to the manufacturer’s website of your graphics card, search for the latest version, then download and install it on your computer. Be sure to download the latest correct driver that is compatible with your operating system.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you’ll get full support and a**30-day money money guarantee** ):

### Fix 4: Upgrade DirectX version

 As this is an error about DirectX, it’s necessary to check whether the DirectX version meets the DirectX requirement for your game.

#### Step 1: Check your game’s required DirectX version

 First of all, you should know for sure the DirectX version required to run the game. You can search for the information from the official website. For example, Call of Duty requires DirectX 11 on your computer.

#### Step 2: Check the DirectX version on your computer

 Next, you should check what the DirectX version is on your computer, and see if it meets the requirement.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**dxdiag** and click**OK** .

3. In the**System** tab of the**DirectX** **Dianostic** **Tool** , you can see the**DirectX** information in your computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c18c7dc5dff8.jpg)

 Then see if the DirectX meets the DirectX requirement for the game. If not, you’ll need to upgrade the DirectX version on your computer.

#### Step 3: Upgrade DirectX on your computer

 Generally speaking, for Windows 10, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1, you can directly update your Windows via Windows Update to the latest version to install the latest DirectX on your computer. However, for Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP, you may need to install an update package to install the latest DirectX on your computer.

 You can go to the **[Microsoft website](https://support.microsoft.com/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx)**  for more information about how to install the latest version of DirectX for different versions of Windows.

 After installing the latest Windows update or update package, restart your computer and try the game again to see if the error disappears.
