1. Type “control panel” in the search box and press **Enter** .
2. Set the Control Panel view by **Large icons** and click **Power Options** .

7. Save the changes and reboot your PC.

## Method 3: Prevent overheating

 If your PC is overheating, you’ll meet a reboot problem while playing a game. Because when the CPU gets too busy it causes high energy and produces heat, your PC will shut down automatically to protect itself. Therefore, to prevent this situation from happening, you have to clean your PC. Clean the dust in your PC and check all the fans are working properly.

 Also, you can use free tools like [HWMonitor](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html) or [AIDA64](https://www.aida64.com/downloads) to tell whether your computer CPU, the CPU core, and the GPU are running too hot.

 Here is a detailed post with more detailed information if your computer is overheating and how you can do about it: [**How to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
