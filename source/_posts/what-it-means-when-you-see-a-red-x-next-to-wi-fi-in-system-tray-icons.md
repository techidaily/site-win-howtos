### Fix 3: Remove Steam compatibility

 Compatibility mode is usually not recommended for Steam to function smoothly. So we might have to turn off the mode to see if the**Store-not-loading** problem gets fixed:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam**  into the box and press **Enter**  .

 2) Right-click on**Steam.exe** and click**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4eda2453493.jpg)

 3) Click the**Compatibility** tab, un-check all**the boxes** and click**Change settings for all users** (or**Show settings for all users** ).
