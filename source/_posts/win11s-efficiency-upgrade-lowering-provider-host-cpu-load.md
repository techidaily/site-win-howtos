 Among various Windows sign-in options, Windows Hello Face can be said to be the most secure and instant way to log in to a device. There isn’t even a need to move a finger—just a smile will do. Despite how convenient it is, some Windows users who try to use this feature have received such an error message:   **We couldn’t find a camera compatible with Windows Hello Face** .

5. Reboot your computer and check to see if Windows Hello Face can work successfully now.

 If this method doesn’t work, go on and try the next fix below.

## Fix 2 – Update your IR camera drivers

 This issue may occur if you are using the wrong IR camera driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your camera driver to see if it fixes your problem. There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your camera: manually or automatically.

#### Manual driver update

 You can update your camera drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your camera, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

#### Automatic driver update

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your camera drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact camera, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

## Fix 3 – Install the FaceDriver file

 This is also a solution that has worked for some people who have received the same Windows Hello Face error message. To try this solution:

1. Press**Windows + E** keys to open the File Explorer. Copy and paste the following path into the address bar, then hit**Enter** .  
`**C:\Windows\System32\WinBioPlugIns\FaceDriver**`  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/face-driver1.jpg)
2. Right-click on**HelloFace.inf** and select**Install** from the pop-up menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

If this trick doesn’t give you luck, try the next one.

## Fix 4 – Restart Windows Biometric Service

 The Windows Biometric Service is responsible for managing the Windows Hello feature and allowing client applications to access and handle biometric data. So resetting the Biometric Service may help with the Windows Hello Face not working issue. This is how it’s done:

1. Press**Windows + R** keys to open the Run box, type**services.msc** in it and then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Run-services.msc_.jpg)
2. In the Service windows, find**Windows Biometric Service** and right-click on it, then select**Restart** form the pop-up menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/windows-bio-service.jpg)
3. Right-click on the Press**Windows + I** keys to open the settings and then select**Accounts** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/setting-accounts-1.jpg)
4. Click the**Sign-in options** in the left panel, select**Windows Hello Face** and then register the Hello Face data again.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/signin-option-hello-face.jpg)
5. Restart your PC and check if you can use the Windows Hello Face now.

Move on to the next fix if this one doesn’t work for you.

## Fix 5 – Run System File Checker

 Corrupted or damaged system files on your computer could also be the cause of the problem. To check your computer for problematic system files, you can perform a system scan.

 You can always use Command Prompt to run the**sfc /scannow** command, but this local utility has some limitations in performing a full in-depth scan. As an alternative, we recommend you use **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . This is a powerful Windows repair tool that can scan, diagnose, and identify faulty system files before automatically and safely repairing them. And it takes only a few clicks:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fortect-download-page-1.jpg)
2. Run Fortect. It will start a deep scan of your system. (This process may take a few minutes).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. After the scan is completed, click **Start Repair** if Fortect detects any missing or broken system files or other issues.

## Fix 6: Disable ESS (Enhanced Sign-in Security)

 If you can still use your camera for other activities, and Windows Hello is the only one that’s with trouble, you can try to disable the ESS to see if it helps. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**I** key at the same time. Select**Accounts > Sign-in options** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-54.png)
2. Toggle off the option for**Sign in with an external camera or fingerprint reader** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-55.png)

Restart your computer and see if the Windows Hello error message is gone.

## Fix 6 – Try the Get Help app

 The Get Help app is a built-in Windows service that can answer your tech-support questions, provide solutions, and troubleshoot some of computer issues. If none of the above solutions work for you, you can try this app to see if it can help.

1. Type**Get Help** in the search box on the taskbar and select it from the search results.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/get-help-1.jpg)
