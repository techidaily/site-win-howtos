### Fix 2: Try another USB port

 If re-plugging the USB drive doesn’t work, you can try another USB port:

 1) When you see the error message popping up, click**Cancel** .

 2) The Windows installation will return back, then**unplug the USB drive** from your computer.

 3)**Plug the USB drive into another USB port** . If you have the**USB 2.0 port** with your PC/laptop, try to**plug the USB drive into the USB 2.0 port** .

4) Try to install Windows again to see if it works.

### Fix 3: Change the settings in BIOS

 The problem can also be caused by the wrong configuration in BIOS. So you can change the BIOS settings in startup.

#### 1\. Change the USB 3.0 support

 Sometimes the  install media doesn’t have native support for USB3.0\. If there is any settings for**USB 3.0 support in BIOS** , change it to**Auto** or**Disabled** .

#### 2\. Change the SATA to IDE

 The wrong SATA mode can also cause the problem. If your machine is using IDE, but the install media boots with SATA, it can result in the problem.

 SATA and IDE are the different types of interfaces to connect storage devices to a computer’s system bus. SATA is short for **Serial Advanced Technology Attachment** , while IDE stands for **Integrated Drive Electronics** . SATA is inexpensive with larger storage, and the IDE has the maximum compatibility.

 Therefore you can try the instructions below to change it in**BIOS** or**UEFI** (the specific steps may vary from different computers):

 1) Boot your computer into BIOS, then go to**Advanced** or**Storage** **Configuration** (or**Drive Configuration** or**IDE Configuration** ).

 2) Go to**SATA** **Mode** (or**Set SATA As** , or**SATA** **Configuration**  ).

 3) Change its option to**IDE** or**Compatible** or**ATA** .

 4) Save the settings and try to install Windows again.

### Fix 4: Change the ISO file format

 The ISO file faulty can also cause the issue, so you can try to change the ISO file format to solve the issue.

 Double check the**extracted setup** from the ISO file. If it is in**NTFS format** , extract the ISO file in**FAT32 format** and use the setup to install Windows again.
