 You can update your camera drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your camera, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

## Fix 3 – Install the FaceDriver file

`**C:\Windows\System32\WinBioPlugIns\FaceDriver**`

## Fix 4 – Restart Windows Biometric Service

1. Press**Windows + R** keys to open the Run box, type**services.msc** in it and then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Run-services.msc_.jpg)

5. Restart your PC and check if you can use the Windows Hello Face now.

Move on to the next fix if this one doesn’t work for you.

## Fix 5 – Run System File Checker

 Corrupted or damaged system files on your computer could also be the cause of the problem. To check your computer for problematic system files, you can perform a system scan.

 You can always use Command Prompt to run the**sfc /scannow** command, but this local utility has some limitations in performing a full in-depth scan. As an alternative, we recommend you use **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . This is a powerful Windows repair tool that can scan, diagnose, and identify faulty system files before automatically and safely repairing them. And it takes only a few clicks:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

2. Run Fortect. It will start a deep scan of your system. (This process may take a few minutes).
3. After the scan is completed, click **Start Repair** if Fortect detects any missing or broken system files or other issues.

## Fix 6: Disable ESS (Enhanced Sign-in Security)

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**I** key at the same time. Select**Accounts > Sign-in options** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-54.png)

## Fix 6 – Try the Get Help app
