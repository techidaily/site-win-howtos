 4) Check to see if your computer still freezes randomly after updating the drivers. If the problem persists, you know your drivers weren’t to blame, and you should try the next fix.

---

## Method 2: Clear your computer’s temp files

 If Windows doesn’t have enough space to store temp files, it can slow down or even freeze. So you should clear them regularly.

 1) On your keyboard, press**Windows key** and**R** at the same time, then in the Run form, type**temp** and hit**Enter** . This will invoke Windows Explorer with your Temp folder open,  showing you all the temp files on your computer.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5940a4d089b3e.png)

2) Select all the files in the Temp folder and delete them.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5940a52e5c1ac.jpg)

 If Windows 10 is still randomly freezing after clearing your temp files, try the next fix.

## **Method 3: Adjust your virtual memory**

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

 1) On your keyboard, press Windows key and Pause/ Break key at the same time. Then choose **Advanced System Settings** on the left panel.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 4) Ensure the **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** checkbox is**NOT** ticked.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 5) Select your windows drive (the hard drive or partition that has Windows installed on it – usually **C:** )**,** and enter an Initial size and Maximum size for your virtual memory:

* **Initial size** – This value varies, depending on your computer. If you’re not sure what value to use, just enter whatever the number is in the**Recommended** category.
* **Maximum size** – Don’t set this value too high. It should be about 1.5 times the size of your physical RAM. e.g. A PC with 4 GB (4096 MB) of RAM should have no more than about 6,144 MB virtual memory (4096 MB x 1.5).

 Once you’ve entered your virtual memory values, click **Set** , then click **OK** to continue.

## **Method 4: Repair your system files**

 Corrupt, damaged, or missing system files can cause Windows to randomly freeze. To check if this is the exact cause, you can either use the Windows built-in tool to run a basic check or use an automatic tool to perform a complete diagnosis.

1. **[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](#reimage)**  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Windows 10/11 freezing. It will deal with issues related to system errors, critical system files and find the right fix for you.
2. **[Option 2 – Manually](https://ukaidot.sjv.io/daqnoj)**  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there’re any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your computer and fix them immediately.

#### Option 2 – Manually

 Microsoft makes it easy for you to get your original system files back. It has an in-built tool called System File Checker that will restore any broken or missing system files that could be causing your PC to freeze.

 1) Press the**Windows key** on your keyboard, then type**cmd** (DON’T press Enter). Windows will display a list of programs that match your search. Right-click**Command Prompt** and choose**Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/run-as-administrator.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If prompted to provide administrator permission, click**Yes** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/user-account-control.jpg)

2) In the black Command Prompt window, type:

sfc /scannow

 Then press **Enter** on your keyboard.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5940aa0c3690c.png)

 Windows will scan your system for corrupted files, and attempt to fix any it finds. The results will display in this window, so please leave it open until the operation is complete.

 If the scan finds no problems, you know your system files aren’t the cause of Windows 10 randomly freezing, and you can move on to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **Method 5: Run a memory check**

 A faulty memory card is one of the most common causes of computer freezes. So before you invest in a new computer, check to see if your memory card is at fault. Microsoft has a built-in tool to help you do this.

 1) On your keyboard, hold**the Windows logo** key and press**R** at the same time to invoke a Run command. Type**mdsched.exe** in the run box and hit**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_58623a9965e70.png)

 2) If you want to check for problems immediately, click **Restart now and check for problems(recommended)** . If you want to check later, click **Check for problems the next time I start my computer** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_57fdb6930a9d3.jpg)

 3) Windows will then restart, and you’ll see this page showing the progress of the check and the number of passes it will run on memory.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_57fdb698e7b6b.jpg)

 If you don’t see any errors here, your memory card probably isn’t the problem, and you should try the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **Method 6: Run Disk Check**

 If you’ve come this far, it’s time for you to check if your hard disk is at fault. Don’t worry, this is easy to do, because Windows has a built in tool for the job…

1) Close all open programs and files.

2) Click **Start > File Explorer > This PC** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5940a917ba7f6.jpg)

 3) Locate the hard drive you’d like to check, right-click on it and choose**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5940a9834949e.png)

 4) Go to the **Tools** tab and click**Check** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5940a9a940e55.png)

5) If your hard disk drive is problem-free, you’ll see this:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_57fdb70907dd5.png)

 This suggests your hard disk is NOT the problem, and you can move on to the next fix below.

 If you DO see errors, it’s possible they’re causing Windows to freeze, and you should consider upgrading your disk.

---

## **Method 7: Disable C-States in BIOS**

 “C-States” is short for “CPU States”. They’re basically power-saving options – they turn down your system’s voltage, multipliers, etc. so your computer uses as little power as possible when it’s idle. Disabling C-States (turning off the power saving options) can make your computer more stable, and reduce the chance of unexpected problems like random freezing or rebooting. To disable C-States:

 1) Restart your computer, and when you see the logo screen (example below), press the**Setup key** defined by your manufacturer. It should be listed on the logo screen. (Different manufacturers use different keys, but it’s usually**F2, F1, Esc, F12, Delete** or a combination of these keys.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/go-into-bios-mode.png)

 If you’re not fast enough, and the logo screen disappears before you hit the Setup key, just wait for Windows to finish starting up, then restart your computer and try again.

 2) Once in your BIOS setup, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate to the main menu. Go to**Advanced** tab, and choose the **CPU Configuration** option.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/img_58d3311bb92d6.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Both **C1E Function** and**Intel(R) C-STATE tech** should be **Disabled** . If they’re not, use your keyboard up and down arrows to navigate the list of options, highlight the setting you want to change, press Enter on your keyboard, then press the up or down arrow on your keyboard to change the value to Disabled.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/intelr-c-state-tech.jpg)

 After changing these settings, save and exit the BIOS settings as per the instructions on your screen, then restart your computer again.

## Method 8: Switch to ChromeOS

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ChromeOSDesktop.jpg)

 Windows is a very old technology. Sure, Windows 10 is relatively new, but it’s still just the latest iteration of a decades-old operating system, designed for a bygone era (pre-internet).

 Now that we have the internet, fast connection speeds, free cloud storage, and endless web apps (like Gmail, Google Docs, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox and Spotify), the entire Windows way of doing things – with locally installed programs and local file storage – is totally outdated.

 Why is that a problem? Because when you’re constantly installing uncontrolled third-party programs, you’re constantly opening the door to viruses and other malware. (And Windows’ insecure permission system compounds this problem.)

 Plus the way Windows manages installed software and hardware has always been a problem. If your computer shuts down unexpectedly, or a program installs, uninstalls or updates incorrectly, you can get ‘registry’ corruptions. That’s why Windows PCs always slow down and become unstable over time.

 Also because everything’s installed and saved locally, it doesn’t take long before you run out of disk space, and your disk gets fragmented, which makes everything even slower and more unstable.

 For most people, the simplest way to solve Windows problems is to ditch Windows altogether, and **switch to a faster, more reliable, more secure, easier to use and cheaper operating system…**

[Google ChromeOS.](https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/)

 ChromeOS feels much like Windows, but instead of installing heaps of programs to email, chat, browse the internet, write documents, do school presentations, create spreadsheets, and whatever else you normally do on a computer, you use web apps. You don’t need to install anything at all.

 That means you don’t have virus and malware problems, and your computer doesn’t slow down over time, or become unstable.

And that’s just the start of the benefits…

 **To learn more about the benefits of ChromeOS, and to see comparison videos and demos,[visit GoChromeOS.com](https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/) .**
