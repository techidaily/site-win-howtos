## 2\. Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card is an important hardware that decides whether your computer can run games smoothly. And the graphics driver acts as an interpreter between Windows and your device. If the driver is outdated or corrupted, you may run into any sorts of problems which can ultimately prevent your game from launching. Therefore, to ensure that you can enjoy your game, you should update your graphics driver:

 There are two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://uperfect.sjv.io/g1jgba) and **[automatically](https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/jrkzxp)** .
