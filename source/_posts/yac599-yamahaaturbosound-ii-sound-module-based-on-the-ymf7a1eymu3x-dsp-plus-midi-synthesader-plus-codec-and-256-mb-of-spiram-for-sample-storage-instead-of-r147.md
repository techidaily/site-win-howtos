## Bypassing Destiny Angled Against the Backdrop of a Serene and Picturesque Landscape, Where an Elderly Man and a Young Boy Are Engaged in the Ancient Art of Tai Chi.

Having an error on Destiny 2 saying:**Destiny 2 servers are not available**? Don’t worry. This is a common Destiny server issue and you can fix servers not available in Destiny 2\.

So you can’t currently connect to the server and get the servers unavailable error. In addition, the network problems in your computer can also result in the error. But the good news is, this is not a difficult issue to resolve.
